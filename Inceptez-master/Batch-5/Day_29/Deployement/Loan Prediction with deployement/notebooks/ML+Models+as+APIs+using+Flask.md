## Machine Learning models as APIs using Flask

### Introduction

A lot of Machine Learning (ML) projects, amateur and professional, start with an aplomb. The early excitement with working on the dataset, answering the obvious & not so obvious questions & presenting the results are what everyone of us works for. There are compliments thrown around and talks about going to the next step -- that's when the question arises, __How?__

The usual suspects are making dashboards and providing insights. But mostly, the real use of your Machine Learning model lies in being at the heart of a product -- that maybe a small component of an automated mailer system or a chatbot. These are the times when the barriers seem unsurmountable. Giving an example, majority of ML folks use `R/Python` for their experiments. But consumer of those ML models would be software engineers who use a completely different stack. There are two ways via which this problem can be solved:

- __Rewriting the whole code in the language that the software engineering folks work__

The above seems like a good idea, but the time & energy required to get those intricate models replicated would be utterly waste. Majority of languages like `JavaScript`, do not have great libraries to perform ML. One would be wise to stay away from it.

- __API-first approach__

Web APIs have made it easy for cross-language applications to work well. If a frontend developer needs to use your ML Model to create a ML powered web application, he would just need to get the `URL Endpoint` from where the API is being served. 

The articles below would help you to appreciate why APIs are a popular choice amongst developers:

- [History of APIs](http://apievangelist.com/2012/12/20/history-of-apis/)
- [Introduction to APIs - AV Article](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/11/an-introduction-to-apis-application-programming-interfaces-5-apis-a-data-scientist-must-know/)

Majority of the Big Cloud providers and smaller Machine Learning focussed companies provide ready-to-use APIs. They cater to the needs of developers/businesses that don't have expertise in ML, who want to implement ML in their processes or product suites.

One such example of Web APIs offered is the [Google Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/)

![Google API Suite](http://www.publickey1.jp/2016/gcpnext16.jpg)

All you need is a simple REST call to the API via SDKs (Software Development Kits) provided by Google. [Click here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-vision/tree/master/python) to get an idea of what can be done using Google Vision API.

Sounds marvellous right! In this article, we'll understand how to create our own Machine Learning API using `Flask`, a web framework with `Python`. 

![Flask](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Flask_logo.svg/640px-Flask_logo.svg.png)

__NOTE:__ `Flask` isn't the only web-framework available. There's `Django`, `Falcon`, `Hug` and many more. For `R`, we have a package called [`plumber`](https://github.com/trestletech/plumber).

### 1. Python Environment Setup & Flask Basics

![Anaconda](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cd/Anaconda_Logo.png)

- Creating a virtual environment using `Anaconda`. If you need to create your workflows in Python and keep the dependencies separated out or share the environment settings, `Anaconda` distributions are a great option. 
    * You'll find a miniconda installation for Python [here](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)
    * `wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh`
    * `bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh`
    * Follow the sequence of questions.
    * `source .bashrc`
    * If you run: `conda`, you should be able to get the list of commands & help.
    * To create a new environment, run: `conda create --name <environment-name> python=3.6`
    * Follow the steps & once done run: `source activate <environment-name>`
    * Install the python packages you need, the two important are: `flask` & `gunicorn`.
    
    
- We'll try out a simple `Flask` Hello-World application and serve it using `gunicorn`:

    * Open up your favourite text editor and create `hello-world.py` file in a folder
    * Write the code below:
        ```python

        """Filename: hello-world.py
        """

        from flask import Flask

        app = Flask(__name__)

        @app.route('/users/<string:username>')
        def hello_world(username=None):

            return("Hello {}!".format(username))

        ```
    * Save the file and return to the terminal.
    * To serve the API (to start running it), execute: `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 hello-world:app` on your terminal.
    
    * If you get the repsonses below, you are on the right track:

    ![Hello World](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pratos/flask_api/master/notebooks/images/flaskapp1.png)

    * On you browser, try out: `https://localhost:8000/users/any-name`

    ![Browser](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pratos/flask_api/master/notebooks/images/flaskapp2.png)

Viola! You wrote your first Flask application. As you have now experienced with a few simple steps, we were able to create web-endpoints that can be accessed locally. And it remains simple going forward too.

Using `Flask`, we can wrap our Machine Learning models and serve them as Web APIs easily. Also, if we want to create more complex web applications (that includes JavaScript `*gasps*`) we just need a few modifications.

### 2. Creating a Machine Learning Model

- We'll be taking up the Machine Learning competition: [Loan Prediction Competition](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-loan-prediction-iii). The main objective is to set a pre-processing pipeline and creating ML Models with goal towards making the ML Predictions easy while deployments. 




```python
import os 
import json
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.externals import joblib
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
```

- Saving the datasets in a folder:


```python
!ls /home/pratos/Side-Project/av_articles/flask_api/data/
```

    test.csv  training.csv



```python
data = pd.read_csv('../data/training.csv')
```


```python
list(data.columns)
```




    ['Loan_ID',
     'Gender',
     'Married',
     'Dependents',
     'Education',
     'Self_Employed',
     'ApplicantIncome',
     'CoapplicantIncome',
     'LoanAmount',
     'Loan_Amount_Term',
     'Credit_History',
     'Property_Area',
     'Loan_Status']




```python
data.shape
```




    (614, 13)



- Finding out the `null/Nan` values in the columns:


```python
for _ in data.columns:
    print("The number of null values in:{} == {}".format(_, data[_].isnull().sum()))
```

    The number of null values in:Loan_ID == 0
    The number of null values in:Gender == 13
    The number of null values in:Married == 3
    The number of null values in:Dependents == 15
    The number of null values in:Education == 0
    The number of null values in:Self_Employed == 32
    The number of null values in:ApplicantIncome == 0
    The number of null values in:CoapplicantIncome == 0
    The number of null values in:LoanAmount == 22
    The number of null values in:Loan_Amount_Term == 14
    The number of null values in:Credit_History == 50
    The number of null values in:Property_Area == 0
    The number of null values in:Loan_Status == 0


- Next step is creating `training` and `testing` datasets:


```python
pred_var = ['Gender','Married','Dependents','Education','Self_Employed','ApplicantIncome','CoapplicantIncome',\
            'LoanAmount','Loan_Amount_Term','Credit_History','Property_Area']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data[pred_var], data['Loan_Status'], \
                                                    test_size=0.25, random_state=42)
```

- To make sure that the `pre-processing steps` are followed religiously even after we are done with experimenting and we do not miss them while predictions, we'll create a __custom pre-processing Scikit-learn `estimator`__.

__To follow the process on how we ended up with this `estimator`, read up on [this notebook](https://github.com/pratos/flask_api/blob/master/notebooks/AnalyticsVidhya%20Article%20-%20ML%20Model%20approach.ipynb)__


```python
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin

class PreProcessing(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    """Custom Pre-Processing estimator for our use-case
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def transform(self, df):
        """Regular transform() that is a help for training, validation & testing datasets
           (NOTE: The operations performed here are the ones that we did prior to this cell)
        """
        pred_var = ['Gender','Married','Dependents','Education','Self_Employed','ApplicantIncome',\
                    'CoapplicantIncome','LoanAmount','Loan_Amount_Term','Credit_History','Property_Area']
        
        df = df[pred_var]
        
        df['Dependents'] = df['Dependents'].fillna(0)
        df['Self_Employed'] = df['Self_Employed'].fillna('No')
        df['Loan_Amount_Term'] = df['Loan_Amount_Term'].fillna(self.term_mean_)
        df['Credit_History'] = df['Credit_History'].fillna(1)
        df['Married'] = df['Married'].fillna('No')
        df['Gender'] = df['Gender'].fillna('Male')
        df['LoanAmount'] = df['LoanAmount'].fillna(self.amt_mean_)
        
        gender_values = {'Female' : 0, 'Male' : 1} 
        married_values = {'No' : 0, 'Yes' : 1}
        education_values = {'Graduate' : 0, 'Not Graduate' : 1}
        employed_values = {'No' : 0, 'Yes' : 1}
        property_values = {'Rural' : 0, 'Urban' : 1, 'Semiurban' : 2}
        dependent_values = {'3+': 3, '0': 0, '2': 2, '1': 1}
        df.replace({'Gender': gender_values, 'Married': married_values, 'Education': education_values, \
                    'Self_Employed': employed_values, 'Property_Area': property_values, \
                    'Dependents': dependent_values}, inplace=True)
        
        return df.as_matrix()

    def fit(self, df, y=None, **fit_params):
        """Fitting the Training dataset & calculating the required values from train
           e.g: We will need the mean of X_train['Loan_Amount_Term'] that will be used in
                transformation of X_test
        """
        
        self.term_mean_ = df['Loan_Amount_Term'].mean()
        self.amt_mean_ = df['LoanAmount'].mean()
        return self
```

- Convert `y_train` & `y_test` to `np.array`:


```python
y_train = y_train.replace({'Y':1, 'N':0}).as_matrix()
y_test = y_test.replace({'Y':1, 'N':0}).as_matrix()
```

We'll create a `pipeline` to make sure that all the preprocessing steps that we do are just a single `scikit-learn estimator`.


```python
pipe = make_pipeline(PreProcessing(),
                    RandomForestClassifier())
```


```python
pipe
```




    Pipeline(memory=None,
         steps=[('preprocessing', PreProcessing()), ('randomforestclassifier', RandomForestClassifier(bootstrap=True, class_weight=None, criterion='gini',
                max_depth=None, max_features='auto', max_leaf_nodes=None,
                min_impurity_decrease=0.0, min_impurity_split=None,
                min_samples_leaf=1, min_samples_split=2,
                min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0, n_estimators=10, n_jobs=1,
                oob_score=False, random_state=None, verbose=0,
                warm_start=False))])



To search for the best `hyper-parameters` (`degree` for `PolynomialFeatures` & `alpha` for `Ridge`), we'll do a `Grid Search`:

- Defining `param_grid`:


```python
param_grid = {"randomforestclassifier__n_estimators" : [10, 20, 30],
             "randomforestclassifier__max_depth" : [None, 6, 8, 10],
             "randomforestclassifier__max_leaf_nodes": [None, 5, 10, 20], 
             "randomforestclassifier__min_impurity_split": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]}
```

- Running the `Grid Search`:


```python
grid = GridSearchCV(pipe, param_grid=param_grid, cv=3)
```

- Fitting the training data on the `pipeline estimator`:


```python
grid.fit(X_train, y_train)
```




    GridSearchCV(cv=3, error_score='raise',
           estimator=Pipeline(memory=None,
         steps=[('preprocessing', PreProcessing()), ('randomforestclassifier', RandomForestClassifier(bootstrap=True, class_weight=None, criterion='gini',
                max_depth=None, max_features='auto', max_leaf_nodes=None,
                min_impurity_decrease=0.0, min_impu..._jobs=1,
                oob_score=False, random_state=None, verbose=0,
                warm_start=False))]),
           fit_params=None, iid=True, n_jobs=1,
           param_grid={'randomforestclassifier__n_estimators': [10, 20, 30], 'randomforestclassifier__max_leaf_nodes': [None, 5, 10, 20], 'randomforestclassifier__min_impurity_split': [0.1, 0.2, 0.3], 'randomforestclassifier__max_depth': [None, 6, 8, 10]},
           pre_dispatch='2*n_jobs', refit=True, return_train_score=True,
           scoring=None, verbose=0)



- Let's see what parameter did the Grid Search select:


```python
print("Best parameters: {}".format(grid.best_params_))
```

    Best parameters: {'randomforestclassifier__n_estimators': 30, 'randomforestclassifier__max_leaf_nodes': 20, 'randomforestclassifier__min_impurity_split': 0.2, 'randomforestclassifier__max_depth': 8}


- Let's score:


```python
print("Validation set score: {:.2f}".format(grid.score(X_test, y_test)))
```

    Validation set score: 0.79


- Load the test set:


```python
test_df = pd.read_csv('../data/test.csv', encoding="utf-8-sig")
test_df = test_df.head()
```


```python
test_df
```

```python

    array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1])



Our `pipeline` is looking pretty swell & fairly decent to go the most important step of the tutorial: __Serialize the Machine Learning Model__

### 3. Saving Machine Learning Model : Serialization & Deserialization

>In computer science, in the context of data storage, serialization is the process of translating data structures or object state into a format that can be stored (for example, in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link) and reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

In Python, `pickling` is a standard way to store objects and retrieve them as their original state. To give a simple example:


```python
list_to_pickle = [1, 'here', 123, 'walker']

#Pickling the list
import pickle

list_pickle = pickle.dumps(list_to_pickle)
```


```python
list_pickle
```




    b'\x80\x03]q\x00(K\x01X\x04\x00\x00\x00hereq\x01K{X\x06\x00\x00\x00walkerq\x02e.'



When we load the pickle back:


```python
loaded_pickle = pickle.loads(list_pickle)
```


```python
loaded_pickle
```




    [1, 'here', 123, 'walker']



We can save the `pickled object` to a file as well and use it. This method is similar to creating `.rda` files for folks who are familiar with `R Programming`. 

__NOTE:__ Some people also argue against using `pickle` for serialization[(1)](#no1). `h5py` could also be an alternative.

We have a custom `Class` that we need to import while running our training, hence we'll be using `dill` module to packup the `estimator Class` with our `grid object`.

It is advisable to create a separate `training.py` file that contains all the code for training the model ([See here for example](https://github.com/pratos/flask_api/blob/master/flask_api/utils.py)).

- To install `dill`


```python
!pip install dill
```

    Requirement already satisfied: dill in /home/pratos/miniconda3/envs/ordermanagement/lib/python3.5/site-packages



```python
import dill as pickle
filename = 'model_v1.pk'
```


```python
with open('../flask_api/models/'+filename, 'wb') as file:
	pickle.dump(grid, file)
```

So our model will be saved in the location above. Now that the model `pickled`, creating a `Flask` wrapper around it would be the next step.

Before that, to be sure that our `pickled` file works fine -- let's load it back and do a prediction:


```python
with open('../flask_api/models/'+filename ,'rb') as f:
    loaded_model = pickle.load(f)
```


```python
loaded_model.predict(test_df)
```




    array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1])



Since, we already have the `preprocessing` steps required for the new incoming data present as a part of the `pipeline` we just have to run `predict()`. While working with `scikit-learn`, it is always easy to work with `pipelines`. 

`Estimators` and `pipelines` save you time and headache, even if the initial implementation seems to be ridiculous. Stich in time, saves nine!

### 4. Creating an API using Flask

We'll keep the folder structure as simple as possible:

![Folder Struct](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pratos/flask_api/master/notebooks/images/flaskapp3.png)

There are three important parts in constructing our wrapper function, `apicall()`:

- Getting the `request` data (for which predictions are to be made)

- Loading our `pickled estimator`

- `jsonify` our predictions and send the response back with `status code: 200`

HTTP messages are made of a header and a body. As a standard, majority of the body content sent across are in `json` format. We'll be sending (`POST url-endpoint/`) the incoming data as batch to get predictions.

(__NOTE:__ You can send plain text, XML, csv or image directly but for the sake of interchangeability of the format, it is advisable to use `json`)

```python
"""Filename: server.py
"""

import os
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.externals import joblib
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def apicall():
	"""API Call
	
	Pandas dataframe (sent as a payload) from API Call
	"""
	try:
		test_json = request.get_json()
		test = pd.read_json(test_json, orient='records')

		#To resolve the issue of TypeError: Cannot compare types 'ndarray(dtype=int64)' and 'str'
		test['Dependents'] = [str(x) for x in list(test['Dependents'])]

		#Getting the Loan_IDs separated out
		loan_ids = test['Loan_ID']

	except Exception as e:
		raise e
	
	clf = 'model_v1.pk'
	
	if test.empty:
		return(bad_request())
	else:
		#Load the saved model
		print("Loading the model...")
		loaded_model = None
		with open('./models/'+clf,'rb') as f:
			loaded_model = pickle.load(f)

		print("The model has been loaded...doing predictions now...")
		predictions = loaded_model.predict(test)
		
		"""Add the predictions as Series to a new pandas dataframe
								OR
		   Depending on the use-case, the entire test data appended with the new files
		"""
		prediction_series = list(pd.Series(predictions))

		final_predictions = pd.DataFrame(list(zip(loan_ids, prediction_series)))
		
		"""We can be as creative in sending the responses.
		   But we need to send the response codes as well.
		"""
		responses = jsonify(predictions=final_predictions.to_json(orient="records"))
		responses.status_code = 200

		return (responses)

```

Once done, run: `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 server:app`

Let's generate some prediction data and query the API running locally at `https:0.0.0.0:8000/predict`


```python
import json
import requests
```


```python
"""Setting the headers to send and accept json responses
"""
header = {'Content-Type': 'application/json', \
                  'Accept': 'application/json'}

"""Reading test batch
"""
df = pd.read_csv('../data/test.csv', encoding="utf-8-sig")
df = df.head()

"""Converting Pandas Dataframe to json
"""
data = df.to_json(orient='records')
```


```python

### End Notes

We have half the battle won here, with a working API that serves predictions in a way where we take one step towards integrating our ML solutions right into our products. This is a very basic API that will help with proto-typing a data product, to make it as fully functional, production ready API a few more additions are required that aren't in the scope of Machine Learning. 

There are a few things to keep in mind when adopting API-first approach:

- Creating APIs out of sphagetti code is next to impossible, so approach your Machine Learning workflow as if you need to create a clean, usable API as a deliverable. Will save you a lot of effort to jump hoops later.

- Try to use version control for models and the API code, `Flask` doesn't provide great support for version control. Saving and keeping track of ML Models is difficult, find out the least messy way that suits you. [This article](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/how-to-version-control-your-machine-learning-task-cad74dce44c4) talks about ways to do it.

- Specific to `sklearn models` (as done in this article), if you are using custom `estimators` for preprocessing or any other related task make sure you keep the `estimator` and `training code` together so that the model pickled would have the `estimator` class tagged along. 

Next logical step would be creating a workflow to deploy such APIs out on a small VM. There are various ways to do it and we'll be looking into those in the next article.
