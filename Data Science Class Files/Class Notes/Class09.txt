Logistics Regression:
	Find the probability for linear model to convert linear 
into categorical.

Terminologies:
Linear : -infinite to +infinite
Take negative exponential to make the range between 0 to +infinite
Divide the number by (number+1) to make the range 0 to 1
odds : winning/lossing or (ratio of winning probability / lossing probability)
log of odds : log(p/1-p) to make logic function
probality : winning/total numer of match

sigmoid function is used to convert linear to probability data

1.Linear data
2.Take exponential
3.Find probability (1/(1+e**-y)) --> sigmoid function

logistic Cost Function : log loss function

Metrics:
1.Confusion

Types of error:
	Flase Positive
	Flase Negative
Accuracy Tp+TN/All
True Positive rate or Recall or sensitivity (TPR) = Tp/TP+FN
FPR=FP/TN+FP
Precision = TP/TP+FP

ROC (Recevior Operating Curve) Curve : (sensitivity or TPR or Recall) vs (Specificity or TNR)
