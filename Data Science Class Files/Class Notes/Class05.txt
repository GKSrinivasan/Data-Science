Statistics
	Descriptive - performaning operation on past data
			Mean,Median,Mode
			std/variance
			Range
			Frequency Distribution
	Inferential - based on sample calculate the entire thing
			Population vs sample

Variables
	Qualitative
		Nominal
		Ordinal
	Quantitative
		Discrete
		Continuous

Dependent - Target Variable
Independent - Rest of variable

Plot : X-Independent Variable, Y-Dependend

Frequency Distribution
	Modality
		Unimodal
		Bimodal
	Symmetry
		Symmetric
		ASymmetric
	Central Tendency
		Mean
		Median
		Mode
	Variability

Dispersion
	Range
	variance (x-u)**2/n
	standard deviation
	Mean Absolute deviation
	Interquartile Range

Percentile & Quartile
	Percentage : calculate out of 100
	Percentile : calculate out of number of record
	Quartile : Q1,Q2,Q3

Outlier = +_ 1.5 IQR (Inter Quartile Range) 
		IQR = Q1 and Q3

Covariance = (x-x1)(y-y1)/n
Correlation = Covariance /s1*s2
	Positive Correlation
	Negative Correlation
	No Correlation
