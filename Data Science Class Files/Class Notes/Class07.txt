SSE : Sum of Square Error
SSR : Sum of square of residual
SST : Sum of Square of Total

R2 : Will keep on increase based on add information
Adjusted R2: will increase when the added information contribute to prediction 
		will drecrease in wise other scenorio

Bias Variance  Trade Off
-Under fitting (High Bias)
-Over fitting (High Variance)

Cost function:MSE

Linear Regression
Assumptions:
1. Linearity
2.No Multi-Collinearity (Avoid more correlation in independent variable)
3.Variance in the residual should be equal
4.predicted value should not have dependency between reach other.
	Example : 10 value depented on 9th value.
