%% Generate data.  

% Set parameters:

% These are fixed

nLatent = 4;                            % number of generative latents

% These can be changed
nTime = 50;                             % time points per trial

aligned = 1;                            % alignment across trials

% X - [nNeuron x nTime x nTime]  contains per-trial binned counts

% Ctrue - [nNeuron x nLatent] 'loadings' of firing rate on latents
