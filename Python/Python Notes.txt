1.Variables
	In this the variables are ref to value not a location. Which means if two variable have same value means it ref to single location which contains the value 1.
2.If else
	Logic same as C#. 
	Define condition without brackets
	Use 4 space instend of {}
	Condition as end with :
3.Function
	Declare function with keyword def (Define function).No {} use 4 Spaces.Logics are same as C#
	append : at the end of function name
4.List
	Array contains all types of data type.
	1 dimensional array itselft contains numeric,string and array also
	Use append() function to add value to an array
	Use pop() function to remove the last value of the array
	We can swap the value of the elements in array using temp variable or based on array index also.
		Ex : b[0], b[2] = b[2], b[0]
		Which means b[2] value assigned to b[0] similarly b[0] value assigned to b[2]
	Array index starts from 0
	If a array or list going to contaion a continous number like 1-100 no need to define entire number in array. We can use range(1, 101) it starts from 1 and end 101-1=100.
		It will give you the range.To convert it into a list use list(range(1, 101)).
5.Loop
	For loop in python is like C# foreach 
	End of condition will have :
	4 space are used to spilt the region
	for i in x:
	    print(i)
6.While loop and break
	We can find the length array by using len() function like len(array name)
	Logical operator are like sql and or
	Boolean Value like True False
7.More about loop
	Nothing new in this
8.Dictionary
	It is kind of temp table. used to store key value pair
	We declare dictionary by d = {} or d=dict() or d={"Key1":value1, "Key2":values=2}
	Value may be of any type
	Key will be either string or int
	Iterate dictionary in python 3.x
		for key, value in d.items():
9.Class
	Declare a class like Class NameofClass:
	With in the class the function will contain a default parameter self (like this key in other language) to access class objects.
	We can define constructor by (2 underscore)__init__(2 underscore) 
	init is a key word we are not able to change it.
10.Class and object
	integer : int
	string  : str
	boolean : bool
11.Using boolean
	we can use type() to find the data type
		Example type(1) or type("name") or type('name') or type(True)
	we have to use (not) in python like (!) in c#
		Example if a>b and not b>c
