Really? I find the star review curious. I cancelled online order and bought the battery version at Best Buy since they had inventory before Amazon. Using settings to mimic a wired (power) version, I can assure you this is not ready for prime time. The settings hierarchy is confusing with the p setting being hidden till you first set it to AlwaysOn, then exit and then go back Custom settings becomes available. The camera barely maintains a connection to wifi indoors. Haven't bothered to install outside since the battery has depleted nearly % in days of almost no and on it's default outdoor wirefree settings. It has not detected any motion when set to ""Window"" mode. The Webb app has yet to play back a single video. Keeps suggesting I ""try again"". Sometimes, just opening the camera settings on the web app will overwrite camera's internal settings even if you don't ask to save anything. On the bright side, image quality is excellent and audio mic and speaker also top quality. That is why I give it two stars. But who cares if you can't connect or the lag is so bad you can't carry a basic conversation. The potential is there if they can fix all this with firmware. At this point, I can't run the risk so returning the product.",2015,"@univ-lyon2.fr, @amisw.com",1002110

I preordered a couple of the Logi Circle (directly from Logitech) after returning a set of the latest Nest outdoor security cameras (ao Amazon). I have previously a set of Logitech Alert cameras (which I loved, but they are no longer available). I am happy to say that the Circle cameras are improvements over the current model Nest cameras as well as the old Logitech Alert cameras. I ordered two cameras along with the window mount adapters and installed them inside, looking out. Installation is super fast and super easy (as compared to both of the other camera systems mentioned above). My experience was a very simple plug and play. Unbox, plug in the cameras, download the app, connect to your network, customize your camera settings, then pop the camera into the stick-on window mount and you're done! Installation of each camera was less than  minutes (including unboxing, download the app and mouting to the windows). This was SO MUCH EASIER than Nest cameras which only offer magnetic and screw mount options (no window mount).  The Nest cameras are also nearly twice as big and much heavier as these new Circle cameras, yet both offer same video quality and  view, same remote monitoring, same two way voice communication, etc. The Circle cameras are smaller, lighter, more discreet and offer better mounting options. The Circle app is also a bit more robust than the Nest app. For example, the Logi Circle app allows you to adjust the monitoring areas. This allows you to set a smaller section of the viewable area to trigger movement alerts. This is great if you have pets and want to set movement alerts to only trigger for a doorway or window. The Circle app also offers a cool ""day brief"" feature that allows you to quickly scroll through all the movement events and alerts of the day. If you have the premium subscription (free for one month after initial set up), you can customize some settings of the Day Brief (if you only want to include ""person"" alerts). The Nest app lacks these features. Lastly, one year of Premium -day unlimited storage for the Circle is only $ per year/per camera versus Nest Aware which charges $ per year per camera (at the time of this review). Again, it is the same quality video, but Logitech offers a much more reasonable cloud storage fee. Improvements I would like to see on the Circle Cameras: ) A feature on the app that allows to adjust the recorded area of view. This feature was included in the Logitech Alert Commander software and I used it to edit out areas that didn't need to be recorded. I would like to see this in the Circle App as well. ) With the window mounts, there are visible reflection ""rings"" from the window mount housing that show up on the video. Turning off the LED and the infrared greatly reduces these ""reflection"" rings, but doesn't eliminate them. I would like to see this improved. Even with this visual ring anomaly on the video stream, it is clear enough for purposes (security) I am still a fan of the window mount. There is nothing else like it on the market so kudos to the Logitech engineers for creating this brilliant window mount. I hope they continue to improve it. ) I would also like to see a local storage option for the Circle cameras. This was also part of the Logitech Alert cameras and Commander software that I had at previous home. The cameras included Micro SD cards, the software would also allow you to assign storage on your local computer AND there were cloud storage subscription options. I really loved these features and am disappointed that the current standard in wifi security cameras is subscription based cloud storage and no local storage options. Granted, you can go in and manually download anything you want, but there are no automatic options (for Logitech Circle or Nest cameras). All in all, I am thrilled with Logitech's newest security camera. Thanks for reading. I hope this review is helpful!",2015,@univ-lyon2.fr,1002106

I also the window mount so I could overlook the driveway. I received the camera yesterday and then spent about hours trying to get it to install. These are the problems I encountered: . The setup guide warns you not to place the camera in direct sunlight. Since I was already committed to putting the camera in a west-facing window, forged on. . To install the window mount, I had to switch the mount+cable on the camera . The camera is very difficult to grasp and align. I dropped it many times trying to get the mount on. . The mount pushes onto the back in a specific location. Then you have to make sure the camera cover is aligned properly. Unfortunately, there are not enough markings on the mount, the camera, or the cover, nor are they very visible if you have old eyes. I finally used a sharpie to draw the alignment points on the camera. . After you push the mount on, you have to rotate it to lock it in, although the guide doesn't tell you that. I found that in a video. . Since there aren't enough markings, didn't know how far to rotate it counter-clockwise to remove the mount later. And like I said, very difficult to grasp. . The power cable is very thin and tangles incessantly. Logitech used to a heavier power cord on its Circle cameras. . I can't find the to register the camera with Logitech. It might be in those tiny faint letters on the camera, but I can't read them anyway. . BTW the window mount has adhesive strips to glue it to the window. THat means it will be very difficult to position, so I'm very disappointed about that too. I ended up going with the standard mount for now. And those were just the assembly problems. . I already had circle cameras, so I only needed to add the circle to the app. But after initially downloading a firmware update, the app couldn't find the camera. . Thinking the problem was with the mounts, swapped them back and forth to find one that worked. I tried connecting via ipad app, but that wouldn't work either. . Finally, moved the circle next to the router. Then ipad app finally found the camera and I was able to finish installing it. I moved the camera to its desired location. The camera and the app A. Even at p, the camera is far superior in resolution to original Dropcam. But it has quite a fisheye effect. B. The main reason I Logi circle is because of its  second Day Brief. It will summarize the day for you into  seconds of key video. THat is so much easier than scrolling through the Nestcam interface. C. This is the first time I am trying notifications and alerts on a circle, so I will report back on any such issues. Sorry for the length of this review, but I am just really frustrated with the poor usability of this camera.",2015,"@gmail.com, @univ-lyon2.fr",1002069

I the Circle largely because it was the only offering I could find with a window mount.  This was exactly what I was looking for, as it allows an exterior view while protecting the camera from the elements and not having to run wire and mount an exterior camera.  The wired Circle works as advertised with no issues.  I did have a little difficulty updating the firmware, which occurs when you first connect the device to your wifi, but for the approximately $ for a wired Circle plus window mount, it is money well spent.  For usage, the free  hours of cloud storage is adequate. I would not consider the battery version, simply because the wired version emancipates you from ever having to charge a battery.  I have the Circle set at p resolution to save some upload bandwidth, and it looks crystal clear.  p and p are available settings.  The web-based interface is easy to use, and allows you to see a live view or select any recorded video to watch or download.  You can also download a snapshot of a recorded video.  Much more could be said, but I am completely satisfied with and will add between - more Circle cameras depending on how much bandwidth they eat.  The motion detection will activate the camera at the slightest movement of a vehicle or person even at  -  feet, so if the camera is pointed at a busy street it will be recording  second clips almost constantly.  Adjustable motion detection would be a good feature, though you can set detection zones if you pay for monthly service.  I prefer to save money and stick with the free  hour cloud storage.

Interestingly the original camera is a Which? Best Buy. The camera is versatile in that it is one of the few (and maybe only) camera designed for both indoor and outdoor use. So it's waterproof without being bulky and works, and looks, fine indoors as well as outdoors. In fact much of the bulk of the camera rests with its mount. This camera comes with swivel mount suitable for placing on a flat surface or attaching to a wall or ceiling with the fixing kit included. There's also an adapter to the camera attached to a window, and an extension cable to allow you to it outside when a power source is not available nearby. The mount supplied with camera is weatherproof so it can be used outside out of the box. In addition you can turn the camera into a wire-free version by buying a battery pack. I think here Logitech bring something new to the market. Also new, I think, is the  degree view. Now the camera only achieves this along the horizontal view, not vertically, but it's by far the widest wide-angle camera I've seen. I suspect in the future we will see  degree security cameras available. They are already available for normal camera useage and a  camera would make sense for home security. In other respects the camera is a little more standard. The image quality is up to p so true HD quality. By default the camera broadcasts in p though, you need to go into settings to change this. Actually  is not too bad. It comes with good nigh-vision, the field of view can be amended from the ultra-widescreen version if you don't need it, and there are a range of motion detection alerts. Unfortunately as with other security cameras, to get the most from the camera you need a subscription with Logitech. Without the subscription you can only review past footage for the previous  hours. The 'basic' subscription increases the review time to  days. Then 'premium' version takes this to  days and allows you to zone areas of interest - so if you want motion only to be detected by doors and windows this can be set up. Advanced processing will attempt to differentiate between different types of motion - the difference between a person and an animal for example - thus reducing the of false alerts. The first package costs √Ç¬£. a month and the second  √Ç¬£. a month of √Ç¬£ a year. You need to judge whether the  hour 'free' review period is sufficient for your security needs. I have a Nest security camera which is double the price of the Logitech version where subscription-free viewing is reduced to only hours making it virtually useless. I also have a Nokia camera at a similar price point to the Logitech offering which offers  hour recording. The camera will link directly to two other smart home devices. An Alexa skill allows you to view the camera's output on an Echo Show. I have a Show imported from the US but unfortunately, as the Show is not available in the U.K. yet the skill is not available. You can control the camera - so set it to privacy mode for example - using an Echo or Dot. This is pretty useful and the Echo Show skill will be very useful indeed. In addition the Circle can be used with Logitech's own Pop buttons. Integration with SmartThings would be an excellent further step. Setup was almost problem free. To get a Bluetooth link to phone or tablet I had to reset the camera but then it worked well. The app is well designed and its is intuitive. Overall, this is a pretty good camera. It is not insanely expensive, as the Nest camera is, and it offers a workable, albeit barely workable, subscription-free option. I like the flexibility of indoor or outdoor with a option for a range of different mounts. I also like the  view and the potential to the camera with the Echo Show. Overall a good four stars.

Item was easy to set up thru the app, it was easily - minutes and the camera was up and running. . It seems to take forever to connect to the live view initially ( seconds at least) even on a Ghz network. It got extremely quicker upon a few resets, to the point of connecting within - seconds. . Had to reset it a few times already due to the camera suddenly going offline and no way to fix it without hands on (have to twist the camera part off and put it back on to reset) and no clue as to why the camera went offline. (Ghz router is ft away with a clean site line). . Figured out how to switch to P under more settings. Took a look at the video and couldn't tell the difference between  &  so went back to . . Camera goes dark with one light on (randomly, does not happen all the time which is weird). So much so any video capture at that point is useless. . Wall mount is not secure at all. I feel like if yo son were to accidentally bounce a ball off the wall it is mounted on, the camera will fall.(either from the 'quick release' or the actual mount that is screwed into the wall.) I'm keeping a hefty blanket under it as I expect the thing to fall, which if it does, I will return immediately. With all that, I am still keeping it as the alternatives are worse IMHO. Everything outside of the mount could be fixed with a firmware upgrade, but if the mount fails as I think it will, it's time to give up. The video the camera does take is smooth and clear (day & night) I just need to figure a way to improve it's mount to feel more secure.",2015,"@univ-nc.nc, @insa-lyon.fr",1002077

I the Wired Circle and the window accessory. I have had two Indoor Nest Cams for a few years now and I wasn't expecting the wired Circle to have the same quality as Nest. I ran into a plethora of problems when trying to set up the Circle . . Good luck getting live mode to work. Live mode didn't work until about hours in. For those hours, live mode was completely black. I know the camera itself was working because I'd get the motion-activated clips. . The lag is WAY too long. Once I somehow got live mode working, it was delayed about  seconds. This is an eternity compared to Nest. Just trying to position the camera took forever because I would have to wait nearly half a minute for the live mode to catch up. . Window ""night vision"" is completely useless. I bought this so I could attached to front door sidelights and other windows in home as a way to see outside without glare or infrared light reflections and also without having to drill into siding and wiring it. When you turn on window mode in night vision, it completely turns off the infrared lights. The infrared lights are how night vision works. Without it, the camera is just on. Now I live in the country so there are no street lights and I don't leave exterior lights on at night. Essentially, window ""night vision"" is pitch black. . Need to change your timezone or wifi? Be prepared to reset the camera and redo all your settings. The camera itself takes a lot of work to use. Unbeknownst to me, I got all the settings how I wanted them only to realize the time was set in California. Changing it is not as easy as selecting a new timezone. You have to reset your camera and add it ALL OVER AGAIN. . To change any settings, you have to the app. You can log in and view the camera on a desktop but if you try to change any of the settings, it will tell you to the app. . No alerts. Sure it ""has"" smart alerts. Meaning it should alert you when it sees movement or a person or hears a sound. My camera/app never alerted me to anything even with me walking up to the camera, waving hands and walking away. . Cannot hear anything coming through the camera. With computer and phone volumes maxed out, you still cannot hear a thing through the camera. In fact, there was an audible buzzing noise coming through from the camera itself. I absolutely would not recommend this camera. The idea of it is great. If it actually worked, it would be a fabulous camera. But it doesn't and it isn't. Compared to Nest, quality is horrible. Set up is horrible. App is horrible. If they possibly fix these software issues, it might be worth getting? In the meantime, I'm returning this piece of s--- and getting money back to buy something that actually works.

I bought the camera with the regular mount, but wanted to it in a window so I bought the window mount in addition because I thought it would reduce glare and make sure that view was as good as can be. I really like the camera, but I am very disappointed with the window mount as it does nothing better than the regular mount did in window. The window mount was also extremely difficult to attach to the camera. I tried and tried, and finally got it on by placing it on a table and using the table to stabilize both sides of the camera. It was very frustrating! I placed the camera on the window mount and found that there was quite a bit of give (it was loose on the mount) and it did not fit correctly into the ring that supports the mount. It made the camera tilt up higher than the originally mount, so I could not see as much of the sidewalk as I could with the regular mount. Further, the window mount did not improve the night vision of the camera. In fact the night vision is not good at all without porch light on. I usually keep porch light on, so this is not an issue, but on the occasion when I am not home and not able to turn porch light on it does not do me any good. I love the picture quality, and I will keep the camera, but I will likely return the window mount. I would have given a higher rating to the camera over all, but the window mount is not good. See the attached photo for an example of the double pane window problem (without the porch lights on).",2015,,1002104

Due to several reported issues by community users with the wireless version such as battery life, video quality, and motion detection I went with the wired version. Please note, most if not all issues, may be resolved by future firmware updates. However, to be on the safe side I a wired version since a battery can be added in the future. The setup process for the camera was easy. Unfortunately, once setup is complete, if you need to make modifications to wifi ssid or timezone settings you need to reset the entire camera and start all over. A bit strange in this day and age. In any case, you're not changing the settings all the time. The quality of the camera is very good with p resolution enabled. Please note, you do need a strong wireless connection and enough bandwidth to reduce lag in live view. Some users complain there's a lag or recordings take a while to show up in the app. Before you mount the camera into your desired location, grab your cellphone, install a Speedtest app and run a test. If you have a poor upload connection then you're most likely going to have issues. You may need to invest into an Access Point or change the location of your router.  Minimum Mbps upload and download speeds strongly recommended Ring recently introduced a competing called the Ring Spotlight Cam. I will test that one soon but based on specs and pricing there are a few important differences listed below. I think Logitech can definitely strengthen its offering with the Circle . Price (Wired Version) - Winner: Circle - At the moment Circle wired is priced at $.. Ring Spotlight Cam is $ Resolution - Winner: Tie - Both p resolution Speaker & Microphone - Winner: Tie - Both have two-way audio Field of View - Winner: Circle - Circle has -degree field of view while Ring Spotlight Cam supports -degree field of view. Siren - Winner: Ring - Ring has a built in siren that can be triggered to scare off an intruder. It also includes LED lights that can be motion triggered, Cable Length - Winner: Ring - Ring comes with a ft power cable that's rated for outdoors out of the box. Circle needs a weatherproof extension to be safe for outdoor use. Mobile App - Winner: Ring - Ring's mobile app is more polished and feature rich. It also supports the ability to add additional users to access the camera. If you want to share the camera access with your husband and wife it's easy to do so with Ring. Logitech currently only one account. Ring also allows you to share a video recording by generating a unique URL to video hosted on their servers. With Circle , you have to download the recording and then figure out how you're going to send it to someone. Overall, security features and ecosystem in Ring's app is more sophisticated. Web App - Winner: Tie - Both cameras have a web interface with their own pros/cons. Smart Home Integration - Winner: Tie - Circle will HomeKit in the future. It will also the Amazon Echo Show. - Ring has not announced HomeKit for its camera but they will most likely have SmartThing integration soon. Which means you can probably automate activities based on motion detection (i.e. turn on lights at night when motion detected). Subscription Plans (Free) - Winner: Circle - Circle offers access to your recording for free for -hours. Person detection, motion zones, advanced alerts, and filters require a paid plan. Ring does not offer recordings for free. You only get access to live streams. Subscription Plans (Paid) - Winner: Ring - This is where Ring shines. There are two options for Ring Video Recording: Basic and Protect. Basic costs $ per month or $ for the year per device; Protect costs $ per month or $ for year, and it covers an unlimited amount of Ring cameras, offers a lifetime warranty and gives you an additional % off future purchases  Logitech is currently charging $ ",2015,@lippmann.lu,1002107

Boy was that a bad thing to do.  It has two main issues. It would not work at night, the camera was totally dark in record mode, but Ok when viewed in live view. To see a live image you had to wait up to a full minute for the camera to wake up. Way too long to be useful. Taking with they say they were aware of it and and working hard to fix it.  When I asked for a replacement they said they would only exchange it for a wired model. I told them I ordered the wire-free model because I don't have power where it is going. No answer to that. So when a software upgrade came out this week I installed it first thing as I had a non working security camera that would not work at night when you need it. The upgrade was successfully installed and that night it did solve the nighttime recording issue. I really didn't see any speed increase in connecting, maybe a few seconds only.  So I thought I had one problem fixed but not both. Making headway here. The next morning I opened the app on iPhone and saw the camera was ""off-line"".  I walked to the camera and it it's LED was blinking so there was some battery change. It had a full battery after the update. Long story short a all day changing and resetting got it working yesterday. But now this morning I find it is again ""off-line"".  I'm out of time working with this camera.

First it says ""waking up from low battery wire-free state"" and then it says ""establishing ... connection,"" whereas the wired cameras go live very quickly.  The battery life is abysmal, even on the default setting where the live view times out automatically rather than on the ""always on"" setting which says it will drain the battery in a few hours.  Although the literature says you can get up to months on the battery, mine lasted less than days on the front porch, even though there wasn't a lot of activity there to record.

The wired version allows the resolution to go up to p or down to p.  p is quite clear, make no mistake, but there is no way to set it to any other resolution.  The wired version just has more flexibility in the settings. Unless you want this camera for a single event that lasts no more than a few days - watching your dogs in a hotel room? In your home while you're gone for a weekend? - or unless you need it somewhere you couldn't get it close enough to a plug to the wired version and would remember to charge it up every few days, I recommend getting the wired camera.  I'll post a review of that camera soon.  I'm really happy with it.  But compared to the other excellent Logitech cameras, this is not a strong contender.",2015,@univ-angers.fr,1002083

Cheap IP cameras don't work with our internet provider, so Logitech's offerings have been our go-to. I've Logitech security cameras since  with the glitchy and somewhat fragile WiLife series (Lukwerks√Ç¬† , we upgraded to the Alert system in √Ç¬† √Ç¬†which had much better video quality, especially in dark conditions, but was still plagued by a clunky and sometimes glitchy interface. When the first gen Circle cameras came online in  I upgraded again and was completely smitten with the unbelievably simple setup and robust features that Logitech offered without a monthly subscription fee. The app is clean and so simple to that Luddite spouse got the hang of it in minutes, and the addition of the Day Brief was wonderful. Even better, I had so much more remote control of the cameras via the phone app,  I could just leave them plugged in and turn them on and off from anyplace in the world. I wasn't expecting much of a change with this nd Generation Circle, but I'm pleasantly surprised by a much clearer picture (see examples), wider lens, waterproofing, and a camera that looks and feels much sturdier than the first gen system. Interface is exactly the same as the Circle , all first and second generation cameras are controlled with the same Circle app, so if you already have Circle cameras you can seamlessly add new cameras to your current arsenal. The Circle also has an array of accessories that make it even more versatile. Although I'm currently using this camera indoors where it is simply propped on a windowsill pointing outwards (the new ""Window Mode"" is excellent, and definitely reduces glare and the annoying bounce-back issues with IR), I plan on getting the Window Mount they offer. The video quality is what really matters with a setup like this, and that is where the Circle really shines over the first generation. It handles shadows and bright sun with aplomb, I'm able to easily see things in the deep shade of our porch when the sun is shining bright behind the subject, it's an amazing improvement. The first gen Circle system was a huge improvement over anything else like it on the market, and the second generation sticks with what worked well before and has added even better video quality and a new array of tools and accessories to make this camera useful in an even greater variety of situations. Definitely recommended!",2015,@iraiser.eu,1002090

Of course, they screwed the pooch. . It's technically a p image sensor, BUUUUT it's not going to give you p video unless you run it on ""always on"" mode, meaning the battery drains in a few hours. So yeah, under normal circumstances, you get p video. . Echo show integration - technically, it works. It takes about  seconds to load, however, making this aspect useless. Arlo loads in  seconds. . Audio - the mic is quite good, the speaker is not. . Load time on mobile: average of  seconds. Guardzilla and Arlo Pro load in half that. . Video quality - as noted, it's normally only doing p, but even THEN it fails. For some reason, over half recordings are so dark they're useless. It's in a fully lit room, so I can't find a reason why. On videos it DOES look well lit, it looks like it takes  seconds before the video lightens up enough to be seen. Image sensor issue? Check out the pic: this room is lit by -lumen bulbs. . Battery life - months? Yeah right. Battery went from a full charge to half, in less than a week. More like weeks. . Motion detection customization: really? I have to go through a browser to do this? What is this, ? There's one thing Logitech did well here, and they did it VERY well. The pairing is done via Bluetooth LE, and it's VERY simple. Kudos on that, at least.

If you want to access all the features, you need to change all the settings as the camera is set to p, with low mic and notifications are disabled by default.

This means that you will never ever know what these features are unless you decide to experiment them on your own, which is not good at all. Even the tab on the app doesn't help as it launches the Logitech Circle website which is a different model. The setup is almost immediate and very easy if you're happy with the default settings.

This is huge problem for me as I need to give access to different people and some of them should not have full access to the camera controls.  For instance, kids, should not be able to turn off the camera in the app. Field Of Viiew The Circle has an  degree field of view. The Arlo Q only has  degeree field of view.  So, the Circle is the winner here. Speaker and Microphone - Both have two way audio.  The audio in the Arlo Q  is slightly better then the Circle . Resolution - Both have  P video, but the Arlo Q is definitely sharper.  The Circle is no slouch here, but the Arlo Q's video is definitely better.  On a scale of - , I'd give the Arlo Q  and the Circle a .  So, again, the Circle video is not bad, it's just not as good as the Arlo Q. Night Vision The night vision is very good on the Logitech Circle .  I would say it is has the same quality, or slightly better, than the Arlo Q. Mounts - The Circle have a variety of mounting options for their camera, s o it wins here.  However, the base of the Arlo Q is magnetic.  This allows you to place the camera on any metal surface.  The base of the Circle should have been magnetic as well.  Next, depending on the how you twist the head of the Circle camera, the center of gravity of the system may change so much that the camera becomes unstable and tip over. You'll need to really play with the cord, in such a way, as to it to keep the whole system from tipping over. Local recording - The Arlo Q plus allows you to insert and SD card and record locally if needed. Software layout and features: Hands down the Arlo Q is the winner here.  There is just no comparison.  For instance, there are instances where I needed to mount the Arlo Q camera and then video was shown upside down.  The Arlo Q has a feature where it can flip the video  degrees so that it shows in the right orientation. I can set the Arlo Q to automatically record if it hears a sound as well if it detects motion. Viewing videos is also much easier to look at.  The videos are organized in a calendar fashion, which makes it much easier to move forwards or backwards in time.  Access to the Arlo Q can be protected by Touch ID on IOS. Circle does not have this feature. Video/Images from the Arlo Q are rotated, on an IOS device, to match the orientation in every direction.  For the Circle , images are only rotated in from one landscape mode to the other.  In portrait mode, the  images/videos are not rotated to match the orientation.  So, there is a little bit attention to detail that is missing from the software of the Circle . Both cameras have motion zones.  However, you need to signup for the paid Circle subscription plan to the motion zones.  Whereas you get that feature included in the base price of the Arlo Q. The Arlo Q scheduling software is very impressive and very versatile. There are default modes on the Arlo Q: Armed, Disarmed, Geo Location,Schedule, and Custom. Armed means that any motion or audio will cause a push notification and/or alert. Disarmed means that motion and audio detection is off. Geo location is whe",2014,@univ-ag.fr,1001986

Ideal if you need to mount behind glass. I have tried various consumer wireless security cameras and I would say that Logitech Circle has a good shot at becoming one of the top ones on the market.  I have tried the Samsung SmartCams, the Netgear Arlo Cams, Nest, Belkin and some other IP based consumer security cameras.  All of them have their pros & cons. NOTE: I set this camera up in early September, so I did not encounter any of the Cloud connectivity issues others have reported. Logitech Pros: - Very easy setup from your smartphone.  There is no separate hub to install, there's no direct IP setting you need to connect to, and there is no separate web app you need to go to for installation.  The Nest and Samsung cams needed you to connect to the IP Address generated by the camera device and the wireless Arlo cameras need a separate hub.  I did have one issue where during the installation the app was trying to update the camera firmware, but it was slow and ultimately failed.  After following the app instructions to reinitiate the firmware install, everything went fine. - The application itself was intuitive.  After having initial difficulty understanding the how to the app because of experience with the Netgear Arlo app, it became very easy.  Let me say this the Arlo application allows you a lot of control and has a lot of settings, but is not very intuitive to use.  The Logitech app is a bit more intuitive, but if you are used to some other software it will take a little while to get used to. - The camera picture and  degree field of view is amazing with the camera.  I thought the Arlo Q picture quality was really great, but I would say that if you set the Circle cam to  mode and  degree field of vision it's better.  The picture is a bit more vivid and appear a bit sharper for the Circle when compared to the Arlo Q. - Love the ability to mount the camera on a glass window.  This is a must have feature for most home as many times mounting the camera outside is not practical.  You will need to buy the separate mounting accessory, but this ability is very cool and it makes the camera a little bit more discrete. - The form factory of the Circle is great.  The camera itself is a circular shape with a pretty shallow depth.  Also, there is a plastic ring that you put over the ""body"" of the camera so that it makes it weather resistant.  This form factor allows you to change the mounts and place the camera in more places.  Again, you will need to the Window Mount accessory if you want the ability to place the camera without the stand. - Black face for the camera and ability to adjust for Night Vision.  This is a big deal for me as I wanted to put the camera behind one of windows.  If the camera face is white or some other color it causes a lot of reflection on the window.  Also, if you want the camera to pick up things in the dark then you need the ability to turn off the LEDs. - Extra long ft of cable for power. - Ability to hear sounds and communicate bi-directionally with audio. - Cloud based video recording.  Good and Bad. - Can access videos via PC on internet browser or via Smart Phone app. - Day briefing software.  Logitech has setup the software where all the motion that has been detected gets summarized in a time lapse for you to take a look at.  This does really help you to quickly scan for anything that happened during that day. - Good integration with Alexa.  I was able to Alexa Show to view the video from the camera. Cons: - Instruction manuals were not easy to follow for me, but Logitech made some really nice installation videos that are posted on Youtube.  I would look at those short videos prior to installation. - Ability to hear audio is good, but I'm not able to setup any alerts via audio.  This audio alert function is great with the Arlo Cams especially if sounds are picked up outside the camera field of vision.  However, currently for the Circle Cam that is not an option. - Not alerts via email.  Wi",2014,,1001974

The differentiation on this Circle wired against competitors is the clever accessories you can - should you feel so inclined. This includes a clever glass suction device that holds the camera against glass, a wireless battery backup back (very clever for those that might be worried about power problems) and plug mount. Setting this camera up is very simple, switch the camera on, start up the free app and then it'll magically connect once you've inputted your password - ruthlessly efficient. After that you create a free account and you are good to go. The app is good, it's weird that it's all in landscape however once you get over that it's easy to use. You can either watch live or move little 'time bubbles' to view previous events it has captured. It uses person detection and motion detection to capture these. The quality is what you'd expect from a p camera but bear in mind that you need to set this yourself as the default is p. The only issues I've run into is that the device doesn't always get a Wi-FI signal as it's m from our outdoor router. A bit annoying so I'll have to reposition it but still very good. It's obviously waterproof and suited to outdoors but might be itself surprisingly easy to steal, unlike some cameras by competitors. I am in two minds as to whether this is a or star product, the reason being that it's very very good, but could have better connectivity. I chose stars as overall it is a good camera with solid functionality which means it does deserve the rating.",2014,"@yahoo.fr, @laposte.net, @insat.rnu.tn",1001971

It gives a great  degree picture ( as you'd expect with some slight distortion) and is effective at monitoring our front door view day and night. The wired kit which I have does not include a window mount or outdoor adapter kit and you can only access  hours of recording on the cloud service - for more you will have to pay a subscription which also gives you access to more sophisticated software features.

The pictures give you a clear view of all arrivals and departures with a click on the app. You can also speak and hear via the camera - it's quite laggy though. The camera itself is really well made and can be swivelled manually into position- it doesn't move by itself. The picture quality has three settings and even on the highest definition I've had no issues with network. There is a generous cable length and the power adapter is included. I do really like this device, however the subscription seems quite prohibitive, particularly as it's per camera should you add more to the system. I haven't got it working with Alexa as yet as the echo show is not available here yet - when it is released I suspect it will add to the functionality of this camera. Overall I'm pleased with it, however a complete system with cloud back up is a major investment and I'm aware that I'm only using a fraction of the possibility this has.

It also ""integrates with Smart Home"" - I don't have a smart home, so didn't check out those options. I like this device as it was easy to and easy to install.

Whilst Daytime image quality is reasonable, Night Vision in particular could do with significant improvement, image smearing is very noticeable with anything moving at more than (a slow) walking pace. I tried that both as a standalone Wired Camera with internal IR illumination enabled and as a Wired Camera/Window Mount combination with external illumination with no significant observable difference. After a month of raising a range of Cases with Logitech Support I've given up and sent the unit back to Amazon. As I packed it up to send back I looked at the parts for the Wired camera and the Window Mount, which I also ordered. At the time I thought it was pretty expensive (√Ç¬£) and you can see how this could be improved when you look at the duplication in parts between the Wired Camera and the Window Mount - another USB power adapter, another UK plug adapter, another European plug adapter, another (slightly different) camera cover, another set of wall-mounting hardware...all low cost but which add to the cost. Why? It's still a * review, while has improved in of progressing queries/problems, resolution of Cases is not being rolled out quickly enough. Original review for Wired Camera: The device was reasonable easy to set up but I found that getting an explanation of some of the settings needed some searching within the Logitech site. Note that the device comes with an introductory free period of Circle Safe Premium which is a subscription plan providing additional storage and functionality compared to the basic free version (Circle Free). Once the free period expires, there are three options √¢¬Ä¬ì accept the basic Circle Free which gives defined functionality and day of storage, Circle Safe Basic (./month per camera, providing no extra functionality, just  days storage) or Circle Safe Premium (./month per camera, . / year per camera, providing additional functionality and  days storage). Personally, I think some of the settings in the Circle Safe Premium should be in the Circle Safe Basic and Circle Free. You can see that although the original outlay may seem reasonable, if you want to get the most out of this camera then the costs will soon add up. In general the device is easy to use, noting that some functionality is only available in the web app, not the mobile app, but the biggest issue for me is the lack of support. I raised a case with four questions, two of which I resolved after more detailed searches but two of which remain unresolved. Even though Logitech Customer Care acknowledged the submissions, there is no subsequent follow up after days. I've raised two other questions subsequent to that. One would think that Logitech would be out to impress and provide major on a new to ensure high ratings but that doesn√¢¬Ä¬ôt seem the case. If they can√¢¬Ä¬ôt provide after launch, it doesn√¢¬Ä¬ôt bode well for future support. So the device gets stars for overall package of ease of set-up and and running costs, - stars for total lack of Customer Care/Support. It√¢¬Ä¬ôs a star package until such time as Logitech actually get their Customer Care/Support team to do just that.",2014,@irit.fr,1001906

Sometimes you receive an item and you are so pleased with it as it is going to address something that you haven't been able to achieve via another product: in this particular instance, we have a small, but important blind spot on our home CCTV system - ideal, the Logitech Circle offered the solution, or so I thought. It arrived and I unpacked it, read the quick start guide, but just in case, I also opened the full set of instructions which are web based.  First impressions were very favourable, it isn't cheap, but for a stand alone battery operated system which can be used inside or out, comes complete with a charger and fixings, I thought ""great"".  Everything about it suggests quality from the frontispiece through to the fixings - the one thing I didn't like was the way that the camera fixes to the bracket, which in opinion is a bit loose, but it will be easy to fix.  So far, so good. I installed the app from Google Play store onto Android handset and eagerly awaited the camera to charge - at the same time I searched Amazon for a second battery as after reading other reviewers comments, it appears that the battery does not last as long as Logitech suggest.  A replacement battery for rotation costs √Ç¬£. as at th September and looks like a future for me should I be able to get the item working properly. Still happy, I commenced trying to commission this item for installation.  The camera needs to be connected to the mains to set up and it was immediately recognised by Android phone as a bluetooth device - connecting to the app was a completely different matter.  I tried repeatedly following the instructions in the app and yet each time, with the instructed blue light flashing, the app would not recognise that the device was connected.  Following the instructions I reset the device, then again and again - removed it from Android phone and reinstalled it from scratch - no joy.  My son then tried with his and his mom's Android phone, no joy there either, finally I tried one last time and for some reason it connected.  With that done, connection to our wi-fi was simple and we were ready to install........spoke too soon, the camera needed a firmware update - oh, well this is quite common, except in this case, despite reassuring messages and two hours the system is still not updated.  Logitech are displaying a message on Android smartphone asking me to ensure that the power supply remains connected and apologise for the slow response from their servers - they acknowledged that they have a problem with the speed of their servers - hardly something which inspires confidence as I assume the same servers will be storing and playing back images. After spending several hours (most reviewers it appears didn't) I finally got the item set up and firstly may I say that the image that it provides is really very good overall; excellent during the day and adequate at night.  You can configure sensitivity and even select individual zones to monitor.  I have attached an image illustrating the field of view: personally I feel that the image is excellent and covers the blind spot for our house, in this regard it is really very good.  There has also been some adverse comments regarding the fact that you have to subscribe at a cost of √Ç¬£. annually to have your images stored for more than  hours - that is correct, however, should you need to, you can download either important images, a particular video clip or a speeded up daily synopsis to either your mobile phone, tablet or in case, imac, provided that it is within  hours of the incident occurring. Overall then, after I got it set up it is working fine or is it?  Well yes it does work, however, similar to the Arlo system, even with fibre broadband there is a significant delay to access the servers when trying to view either live view or recordings - to a certain extent I can understand ANdroid smartphone perhaps having a delay, but imac is wired into ",2014,"@univ-st-etienne.fr, @fst.rnu.tn",1001935

The camera is indeed waterproof and will work outside via your current wireless set up, however doing so will impact the battery life and √¢¬Ä¬úup to√¢¬Ä¬ù month battery life advertised will be more like - weeks depending on where you place it.  As backed up by Logitech themselves the issue with using the camera outside is that movement of trees or people walking past will wake the camera up from low power mode which obviously uses the battery more.  The camera does however work well outside and even in poor conditions I would just advise that anyone looking to them outside to a wired extension cable which can be supplied separately. My test for the Circle has been mostly indoors placed in lounge. The Logitech Circle boats  degree wide angle lens, Weatherproof, Motion Detection with HD video and Night vision. I found that the set up I chose to test works perfectly, I can see the whole of the room from the corner although the ability to move the camera around from your device (not that you need to) is missing and there is no zoom.  You can pinch in and out to look closely at certain area√¢¬Ä¬ôs but as there is no zoom this just makes whatever you want to make bigger pixelated.  Night Vision works very well, I can clearly see everything in the room when it√¢¬Ä¬ôs pitch black.  The Motion detection takes a couple of minutes to send a notification to your device and then depending on your location, could take a further minute or so to wake the camera up.  This is only if you want to view the camera live, the device will have already sent a short video to the cloud which you can store up to  hours of storage which is plenty as this will only record if there is movement (You can take a subscription for longer should you need). Extras Should you want to talk to anyone invading your house you can do so via the app (I√¢¬Ä¬ôm using IOS).  This works both ways and you will be able to talk clearly through your camera and pick up any responses.  Great for scaring your partner when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre out of the house but probably not what it was designed for. The mount that comes with the camera is a little flimsy and the weight of the camera can move it, I wasn√¢¬Ä¬ôt too impressed so decided to not it. The App Works really well, you have the live setting on the main screen and also any past movement recorded plus a Day Brief which shows anything recorded during the day in a  second clip. These can easily be deleted by holding down the circle you are viewing or you can save the clip to your devices. On the live setting you can listen and speak through the device although you have to hold the icon down, I would have preferred an on/off style icon instead. Other settings involve turning the camera on/off, setting Privacy mode so you can continue streaming but not record any movement, this also stops notifications.

I know the camera can be set up outside, but it would not have been convenient in particular case.  Top marks. The App.  Seamless installation on Mac, iPhone and iPad.  On mobile device, I find it a bit surprising the app is only in landscape and does not tilt.  Apart from this, everything is smooth and straightforward.  Fine tuning the camera is very easy and no need to spend time wondering how things work The video feed.  I've subscribed to the one month option as it can be very useful.  The day brief is a fun way to see what happened over the last  hour (or other period) in a clip of up to  seconds.  The only missing thing in view if the option to access recordings outside what the cam has selected as an alert. Overall - extremely pleased with this cam.  Logitech has produced a very smart and versatile item",2014,@univ-nantes.fr,1001956

First things first, the security system comes neatly packaged, looking high quality from the start.  It is simple to set up and get working. It struck me how small it is, but the camera itself is very obviously a camera, so no discreet monitoring is going to be happening with it.  We principally got it for keeping an eye on our miniature poodle when we are out and about.  I don't think he's too bothered about the aesthetics of the camera!  It can be used inside and out, which in itself, is innovative.  The camera and mount are waterproof and a cabling kit is included.  When in use, there is a bright green LED light at the front of the camera...another giveaway...but this can be disconnected if preferred. The  degree facility is also innovative, but is only in the horizontal plain. If you want to hold on to recordings for more than  hours, you will need to a subscription (prices vary).  It all depends on what you wish to the system for and if you are away a lot. All in all, a neat, modern with a couple of small drawbacks.",2014,@univ-orleans.fr,1001931

Literally plug-n-play: plug in the camera, download the app on your phone, connect it to your wifi and you are done. Now the not-so-good points: it would have been better if the camera was wireless but that aside, it's also not very discreet. When you plug it in, there is a green light that comes up on the front of it and there is just no way you can hide it from anyone. It's quite obvious it's a camera, which frankly defeats any monitoring objectives. In addition to that, when you log in to the app in your phone, the white light comes up too! It's also a bit slow. Internet connection is quite good where we are but there is still significant delay in both recording and audio playback. There is also interference in audio, so there is quite a bit to be improved on. Picture quality is good though and the camera has quite a wide viewing angle, so you can see pretty much the entire room from a single camera.

The Logitech Circle Wireless Home Security camera is supplied a single fixing bracket which is easily attached to a wall (indoors or outdoors) by two screws. The camera unit then snaps on / off the fixing bracket and seems very sturdy while in place but this also means it can easily be moved elsewhere if desired. It can also stand on its own so if you want to it indoors but not mark your walls or you want to move it around in the house to different rooms you can easily do so. The only limit to where it can be placed seems to be the strength of your Wi-Fi signal. Although it is called a security camera, it can be used indoors or outdoors for a variety of purposes. Those with young babies might want to set it up in babies bedroom to monitor the baby sleeping. There is a useful feature that allows you to listen to sounds through the camera's built-in microphone and speak to someone through the camera's built-in speaker. Another might be at the front door as a sort of entry-phone to monitor callers.

Oh right because then you couldnt make more money. Got it. I do not feel even remotely comfortable allowing Logitech to be able to view and monitor all of the recordings coming out of home, they can be hacked and this information can be given to the wrong people who would know exactly when you were home and what you get up too. I think this is far too intrusive and can be used for nefarious purposes. I cannot find any information regarding how secure your recordings would be, but do not trust it at all. Ive read in the papers before where technical operators would frequently access users videos and watch them and even sell information to criminals. Some people might trust Logitech and their operators. I dont. But im paranoid, and frankly realistic.

You can the wired version where it can be tethered to a mains power supply √¢¬Ä¬ì indoors or in certain outbuildings etc. - or the rechargeable battery powered fully wireless version where no other power supply is available. Both versions are weatherproof for indoor or outdoor but whichever version you choose for your location you will need to be in range of your WiFi router to the features, so that may be a limiting factor, and to get the very best service from the cloud storage service you will need a subscription to one of the Circle Safe plans.

There are a good range of accessories also available on the same Amazon page making the camera easier to set up in certain locations √¢¬Ä¬ì a good choice for business installations or more professional home security setups.

The camera looks and feels well made. It looks relatively modern and small so isn't hugely intrusive when placed within a room. Setup was very simple and it was up and running very quickly. The field of view is good - covering our entire room - and the night view is also good. The motion detection during both the day and night is around m. Once your months trial subscription runs out, you're then onto  hour cloud storage only. In opinion this is too short - unless you're checking the footage every day - therefore you have to factor in the cost of the subscription, (currently √Ç¬£ or √Ç¬£ per month), when considering this camera. During the trial you have the full premium feature set which includes customisable motion detection, person detection and ""what's happened today"" feature. All of these features work well, but in order to continue using them you have to then subscribe, (and the subscription is per camera, not per household). The app is relatively simple to use, but it would be nice if the privacy setting were easily accessible, (and I'm not % happy with a privacy setting that still streams pictures but doesn't record them). The biggest frustration that I had with the app was when phone wasn't connected to WiFi when the whole experience became slow and awkward with video clips starting to play and then stalling after - seconds. This camera is pretty good and I would give it . stars if I could. However, overall I prefer the Arlo Pro - mainly because you do not require a subscription, the Arlo gives you the choice of recording locally and has more customisation settings. However, if you want to keep a live view of a room, to keep an eye on your pets for example, then this camera will easily do a good job of such a task.",2014,"@cnam.fr, @cnam.fr, @cstb.fr, @cstb.fr",1001947

Again if your placing it in your window sill then white might be a good choice to match the surrounding. With the App (which you need to make this cam work) you can it for a people conversation so keeping in touch with the baby sitter for instance or the wife while at work, check up on elderly people. There is a batter inside this baby despite it being powered by mains so you can easily move it around but it only lasted me about and half hours so making it only useable for popping out for a few hours if you intend to move it somewhere where a power socket is not workable or too far away. The mains is connected via a USB  foot cable and adaptor. You get a plastic wall mounting plate for wall mounting rotating baseand you can remove the camera off this for moving about if you so wish as it just clips and unclips off easily. Incredibly using this in the dark is just as good as in normal lighting only difference is what ever is black for instance will be in reverse (white) but the detail is amazing. When working with the App it seems to work flawlessly and I do like the time stamps that are actually more then useful for fast forwarding or backwards to a certain time to check on an event. With the app you can get an alert if there is movement in your home while away, though this may not work if your have pets (I don't). Being able to it via an app also means features will be updated constantly so hopefully making it more useful. I'm very impressed with this camera its just what I needed to replace last one which kept becoming unreliable and the app would constantly break down but no problem so far with this one and I will update review if things change in the future.",2014,,1001951

It sits low on a surface, reducing its visual impact but can also be wall mounted, which is ideal if placed in an exterior location. √¢¬Ä¬¢ Setting up Setting up is very easy even though initial reaction on opening one of the two inner boxes was one of dismay at the apparent of √¢¬Ä¬òbits√¢¬Ä¬ô. The plug comes in three pieces with a two-pin version to discard and the UK three-pin front to be slotted onto the back of the plug. Convenient for the manufacturer albeit creating unnecessary waste. The camera attaches to the mount via a slot and twist movement then it is just a matter of plugging in and downloading the App. Unlike some security systems, the App is easy to find as well as set-up. I just needed to select broadband account and input the password, everything else was automatic and straightforward. Note that although the camera is suitable for exterior mounting to do so you need to the weatherproof extension, which is available separately. √¢¬Ä¬¢ Subscription The camera comes with a short trial of circle safe premium ( days) so you can assess whether to subscribe √¢¬Ä¬ì it costs √Ç¬£ for a year or √Ç¬£ per month currently. A more basic subscription is available for √Ç¬£ per month or a free option provides  hours of footage. I like some of the premium features such as the ability to create motion zones and timelapse recordings but haven√¢¬Ä¬ôt yet decided whether to subscribe. √¢¬Ä¬¢ Use The field of vision is about  degrees and it is possible to zoom in for a closer look at anything of interest without losing too much picture quality (noting that I am using this inside).  I like the facility to get a day brief √¢¬Ä¬ì a timelapse recording of what has gone on, which you can also download for future reference although this is only available with the premium subscription. It is possible to have two-way conversations so you could speak to a caller at the front door, for example, if placed outside. √¢¬Ä¬¢ Negatives There are a range of lights on the camera that alert you to its various states and, as far as I can tell, these cannot be switched off. The lights are not particularly prominent during the day but stand out at night, particularly drawing attention if placed outside. I would like the option to switch off entirely as, whilst accepting the deterrent effect of someone seeing somewhere has CCTV, I would like to ensure the camera is not the first target for any would be intruder. The lights mean the following: Blinking blue: waiting to pair Solid white: camera connected Solid green: someone watching/viewing Solid yellow: privacy mode Solid red: camera off or not recording √¢¬Ä¬¢ Summary I like the camera and would love it if I had the option to turn off the LED indicators. It records good quality footage and it is nice to have the option to see a day of events without needing to subscribe to anything (albeit not as a timelapse). Other recording options are available at a price but a day is sufficient to cover most things, particularly if viewing remotely to keep an eye on things.",2014,"@checksem.fr, @crossknowledge.com",1001979

If you want to this inside on a window it is possible to do so ( I chose to do so and have used it through double glazing, like most people probably will) to do so,it is probably best to buy the window mount as using a cheap suction mounted tripod ( which leaves a gap between the camera and the window) gave me quite a lot of reflection from the glass on the recording. Subscription ::::::::::::::::::::: To get the most from the camera a subscription is required- these can be bought for various lengths of time, from weeks( long enough to store coverage from a holiday) to a year. Without a subscription you miss out on footage recorded from any time before the last  hours. You also need a subscription to set up a zone where your phone doesn't alert if it is within a set distance to the camera.",2014,"@gmail.com, @fsegs.rnu.t, @fsegs.rnu.t",1001973

I have been looking around at security cameras, but had been out off by the lack of security the devices themselves had. So I was very happy to see that this Logitech Circle wireless home security camera was up to the latest security spec. The camera comes in two parts, the camera itself, and a battery housing which the camera fits into. You get with it the USB charger and micro usb charging cord. It takes roughly a day to fully charge it. The camera front itself is not flat, it sticks out a little and there is a circular lenses in the middle. You can level the camera by the Logi name been readable, otherwise the picture when you view is will not be straight. The camera wakes up when it detects movement. You get a free tiral of it keeping actions through the day, but only lasts for  days before wanting a subscription. The setup of the camera is straight forward, you download the app to your mobile and configure everything. Otherwise you will probably need a PC which can access wifi to configure. Initially it appears to be BlueTooth setup. Since having it for just over a month at the time of writing this review, there have been updates, and firmware updates. Sometimes it has issues waking up from low power state and connecting when trying to view Live. The quality is HD, and you can zoom the picture quite nicely by at least a factor of two, but can zoom in even more is needed. You can take stills of the picture been shown. The press to talk and listen really does not work very well. Usually you can bearly hear the person, and they can only hear crackles. The camera itself is not waterproof, and so should not be placed anywhere where it is likely to get wet.

Having the ability to switch between three different angles of view while still remaining HD is a very nice feature - no more switching out CCTV lenses.  degrees at one end is super wide, enabling you to monitor a whole room from one corner, and about  degrees no the other - still giving a respectable field of view, but with more chance of identifying peoples' faces. On the other hand, I have had issues with the camera transmitting a 'snowstorm' for no apparent reason, for hours on end, and no obvious way to fix the problem. There's no 'on/off' button where you can just re-boot it. The supplied mount is rather floppy, and not really man enough to the weight of the camera in almost any angle. I can see no way to make it more stiff either. Fortunately, it has a standard camera tripod screw in the base, so you can that to mount it onto a cheap camera stand. The built in battery does last well, when running in 'disconnected' mode. It optimises power to minimise consumption. It is powered via a standard Micro-USB port. Unfortunately the cable does not appear in any way to be 'waterproof' so you can't really have the camera mounted outside and permanently connected to power, which really means it's going to be used for inside only. I can't see people climbing up and down from the eaves of their house every couple of days to recharge it, and you wouldn't place an expensive gadget like this somewhere someone could easily pinch it. So why make it waterproof? Maybe the intention is that if you want to it outdoors, you swap the base for a permanently wired version? I love the daily activity review, and the way the camera identifies motion, the way it controls exposure, and the night vision (with range really limited to a standard room). My view is that its ideal is as an in-house monitor to see if your baby is OK, or your kids are wrecking the place when you're out in the garden or on holiday. With alerts, it would probably be quite useful as a burglar alarm too. Just be aware that it has no local storage - all footage is streamed from the camera out to the internet, and the app pulls footage down from there, so if you lose internet, you lose the ability to capture footage. Also, there is a 'free' cloud storage option, but it limits you to a single day of footage, and it excludes the ability to create custom detection zones and enable person detection. For all features to be enabled, you need a √Ç¬£ a month subscription. So in summary, a great picture, and great software, but you should probably look for another solution for monitoring outdoors. I think this should be treated as an interior camera only. Budget to buy a separate tripod/stand too.",2013,@univ-tours.fr,1001830

The camera is well-made and looks sturdy. Box contains the following items: 'quick and easy setup instructions' which are in German, French and English; the rechargeable battery which forms the back of the camera module; the weighted swivel base and quick release plate which the camera clips onto so that it can be free-standing; the wall mounting bracket with screws and wall plugs which allow the camera to be mounted on a vertical wall and the USB charger which plugs directly into a power socket. There are also two plug adapters provided which clip onto the power charger. One is a UK -pin plug head, the other is a -pin European head. Finally, there is a cm USB cable with a Velcro cable tie. There are four steps to setting up the camera. First you need a high-speed, Wi-Fi internet connection and a smartphone running iOS . or later or Android . or later which has Bluetooth. Then you attach the camera battery to the camera head and connect them to a power supply. Then you download the free Logi Circle app from your smartphone's web store.  Launching the app, you then follow the onscreen instructions to complete the set up. You need to create an online account with Logitech to the Circle . Once the camera battery is charged, it will operate wire-free. You need to place the camera in an accessible place in order to remove it for recharging. If placing the camera outside it also needs to be in a place that is accessible for you and not others. Being clipped onto the base mount it could be easily stolen. Being white in colour, it is noticeable if placed on an outside wall. There are other optional mounts available as a separate purchase. The camera needs to be placed within range of the Wi-Fi router. It is recommended not to place the camera in direct sun. It will operate in temperatures between -C and C although night vision works up to C. When you set up the camera there is a free trial of the Circle Safe Premium service. This has extended video storage of  days and key features like person detection and creating motion detection zones. At the end of the trial you can choose not to continue the premium service and lose these facilities or pay √Ç¬£ per camera a year subscription (or √Ç¬£ per month). There is a basic account for √Ç¬£ per month which offers  day storage of video but not the advanced features of person detection and motion zones. There is also a free account option which has day storage of video. All accounts have unlimited uploads and downloads as well as smart time-lapse.

Unusable. I'm EXTREMELY displeased with the Logi Circle camera. When it actually worked, the wire-free model took *far* too long to display an image. When it displayed the image, it took a good thirty seconds to adjust to the lighting in the room. The app is cartoonishly designed and difficult to use, too. Running it in wire-free mode runs the battery out in DAYS rather than months. I tried to connect the plug to the item, but that didn't seem to make it last any longer before it died. Shocking for a whose primary goal is to provide peace-of-mind. When I attempted to update the firmware as suggested to help the battery life, it tried updating for more than  hours and now appears to have bricked the camera. So now I'm stuck with a $ paperweight. I wish I could return it but at this point I cannot, as the return window closed shortly before the bricked.

Out of the box there are very limited instructions but it is very simple to set up and get working. I downloaded the app, put the camera together and connected it to our WIFI and it was up an running in no time. What is more complicated is the wider instructions as to how to it for longer periods of time. It took a while for it to dawn on me but you can basically this camera for  hour periods and access live feed or recordings for that period. If you want longer (say to cover a weekend away or holiday) then you need to subscribe to a cloud storage service which costs. At present I've not gone with the extra cost option but it seem pretty affordable to me - you'd have to compare it with other similar services. For me this is a really useful thing to have for what I needed it for. I work from home and spend most days tapping away on computer up in the attic. This camera gives me a live feed to what's happening floors down - keep an eye out for the postman, check if the kids are ok if I need to just nip up and finish off some work when they've got back from school. It's also good to be able to play back any significant activity (the camera seems to switch on when there is  movement in front of it). Thus far this has only resulted in hilarious videos of the kids trying to sneak past it without it turning on but it's good to have in case of a break in or attempted break in as I've got it overlooking our dining room which is the middle hub of the house and has a big window going out onto the front door. Another thing that wasn't clear is how well it works outside - I've ordered it for indoor but there seem to be other accessories that weren't included in this but would be handy for different vantage points (weatherproof cabling/window mount).

Lack of connectivity- never had any problems with circle but circle disconnects all the time. It's next to wifi and next to circle but it literally won't stay online for more than a week. .

I planned on using outdoor cameras to activate lighting zones in addition to being used as security cameras. Operationally while the camera was working it was fine for a few hours. The cloud based smart camera features worked well and the price of the service was acceptable. The problems started on the first night when the camera went offline and stayed offline until it was reset. This happened again on the second night and bricked after the reset. The camera uses Bluetooth to setup using a smartphone app and despite the status light (and several resets) none of devices could connect to it using Bluetooth. The Camera was totally bricked.

Frankly, I'm not ready to spend money on a that isn't supported after sales, I'll probably look into another surveillance camera with smart home integrations.

The means you need to an extension from Logitech if you are further away from a plug in for $. (!). This extension is included in the price of the Nest Cam making it cheaper if you need one. - Homekit documentation is almost non existent. I had to web searches to find out that the HomeKit setup is hidden beneath the rubber shroud. There are a of HomeKit setup features that make adding accessories easy and Circle has non of them. - The reset button is very difficult to through the rubber shroud; it has terrible tactile feel and requires a lot of force to make work.

The nighttime illumination works is super clear for about m and then the image dissolves slowly into the distance. The mount is very simple to attach to a wall; and the camera slides onto the mount easily. The camera is powered by USB; there is a battery that will hold over for about two hours if the power goes out (I tried it mostly after work on battery so it may be running at night more power and that explains the time being an hour lower than Logitech rates.

Youd notice it, but you wouldnt necesarily think ""CAMERA!"" - it looks like it could be a security light or sensor of some kind: so indoors its not ""ugly"" and kind of blends into the room. I dont like the subscription model they use; the basic software gives a  hour recording/  review period - paying extra extends that so you can review a longer period. The extended period is probably only REALLY useful for a few people (eg if you go away a lot with work or have a you leave unattended over weeknds etc), but because footage is stored in the ether rather than a physical hard drive, it means if you want that longer recording period you need to pay a premium for it. Frankly Id rather hook this up to a tablet or laptop and be able to keep video offline for free. Its initially cool to be able to remotely view your - but the novelty wears off; which again is why Id rather just locally store footage for review if I needed it. Ive tried this camera both indoor and out, and the first thing that impresses me is that regardless of where you put it, you get a great video performance (I always thought with these versatile cameras that one setting would provide a better experience due to things like low light vs sun shining directly on it - nope; both environments give as good as the other. Indoors, I set this up in kitchen for the trial run, as it meant I could put it somewhere without needing to drill holes in walls. Day and night it captured great quality, clear images (the low light/ night footage was surprisingly clear - cat helpfully went for a roam around the kitchen in the dead of night and rather than a shadowy blob, I could see him very clearly sniffing things, trying to break into the Dreamies drawer and cleaning his aris) I then moved it outside: the positioning of house means the sun tracks across the front all day, so I mounted it on porch to test the various lighting levels - it worked great the full  hours; night time was a little creepy to watch as I kept expecting to see Slenderman, but all it captured was a couple of leaves blowing around. Daytime recording gave me a clear shot of the postman and an avon lady - you could clearly make out their faces - and me going to and coming home from work (hideous seeing yourself on camera!); The point is whatever time of day, I was pleased with the picture clarity and also how far the camera ""sees"" - I couldnt make out all license plate numbers but as cars drove by on the road near house, you could clearly see the colour, make and model of cars; and I have a large front garden, about ft from the gate to the front door, so that long reach clarity impressed me. The negatives for me are: The way it stores video - ie in the cloud; Id rather they were on a drive so I can keep longer videos. I dont see the point of a short term recording, and I dont like the way you have to pay for longer periods when youve already paid a premium for the kit itself (granted I didnt buy this, but if I had paid √Ç¬£ without realising the added charge to unlock the full potential of it, Id be cross) The cable is quite long, but depending on where your power points are in relation to where you want to mount it, you might need an extender cable. for outside, wireless/ battery opp might be better It uses wifi - Its not going to eat up your monthly allowance BUT if you dont have a decent wifi signal you might have issues If its in an exposed area, and it rains, the lense can get a bit ""vaseline effect"" from the watermarks.

The video quality is excellent!  Depending where you can mount the camera, it's as clear as HD television. The app is pretty good, and you can tinker with a lot of various settings to your preference.  The Day Brief feature is pretty good, not as functional as the old Alert camera's Commander was, however.  You could set the fast forward rate on that one.  With the Circle app, you have to just watch at a single speed.  It's still very useful.  You can zip through the day until you see papers appear all over your family room floor, at which point you can go to that specific time period and watch your dog chew up the newspaper in real time. I like that I can press the Talk on Live view and speak to someone on the porch.  The sound isn't cell phone quality, but it's generally comprehensible.  It isn't extremely loud, so the hooligans need to be on your porch for you to yell, ""Hey, you kids get off porch, dammit!"" like a crazy old man.  I like that you can opt to record sound or not.  In the family room, for instance, I don't need to hear the TV show that was on, but it's good for the porch. I like being able to watch remotely, too.  You can set the camera on Privacy mode, which means you can call up the app and watch live, but nothing is recorded.  So, for instance, you don't need the vision of your visiting brother-in-law scratching his, uhm, nose seared into your memory, but it's nice to be able to tell the kids to pick that stuff up before you get home. The cameras are pretty easy to set up, too.  I had all mine up and running about  minutes, and much of that was figuring out viewing angles.  I find indoor cameras and back porch one very reliable.  The front porch one less so. What's not to like?  Changing the WiFi channel has to be done by physically pressing the reset button on the camera itself.  If your camera is mounted outside and up high, that means bringing it down (with its stapled up power cord unless you have another at ground level), making your adjustment and reinstalling it.  The same for the time zone.  The time zone?!  I haven't always been successful at resetting them either.  Press the button and wait for the light ring to change color ... The front porch camera records every car that drives down the block and every cyclist on the street (in case I'm dying to know) but sometimes a flier will suddenly appear in a frame with no record of whomever strolled up to front door and taped it to the door knob.  I don't get that.  During the night, moths are attracted to the infared, so I have lots of flitting footage, but I guess there's no fix for that.  Lol, once I got great footage of a lizard crawling across the lens in search of the spiders who sometimes nest nearby.  That was awesome. I don't like that sometimes when the camera needs attention or is getting adjusted it beeps really loudly.  My husband has had to call me at work to have me fix something through the app.  Why wouldn't a phone app notification suffice? Sometimes when a camera needs an update, it just stops recording!  I've gone to look at footage and see a red dot on the menu marker but nothing recorded.  If that happened at a critical time, I would be livid. Worst, front porch camera just goes offline a lot.  That really defeats the purpose of having a front porch camera, doesn't it?  It can only be reset by physically unplugging the cord and plugging it in again.  We used to have a dog sitter who would unplug our previous back porch camera when she wanted to have unauthorized company, but the front porch camera which she evidently didn't notice, caught it.  I can just see calling her up and asking her to reset that front camera please so I can see if she's sneaking people into home.  :/  I have a new critter sitter who knows where cameras are and none are any place a person should have absolute privacy (don't be a creep.), so I would feel comfortable asking her to reset that camera.  I just don't think I should ha",2013,"@ensi.rnu.tn, @ensi.rnu.tn, @ensi.rnu.tn",1001844

The camera itself can capture images in P Full HD, you need to turn this setting on though as it's setup to capture in P by default. Using the mobile app you can view what's happening and receive alerts when motion is detected. It also features a speaker and microphone so if you need to talk to a family member or pet then you can do, something I've used once or twice and it works as expected. One downside is that you can only view  hours of footage, which is fine at the moment just using it in the home. If I plan on using it outdoors then I may need a longer period of stored footage, for this you have to pay a subscription fee. So you will need to consider your usage and whether you want to pay an extra fee for this feature. There are a range of accessories for the camera, such as a window mount and a rechargeable battery so you can go completely wireless. Of course these come at an additional cost, but depending on how and where you the camera they might be a valuable addition to your setup.

If you're looking for the widest field of view ( degrees), aren't committed to a smart home ecosystem, and prefer to avoid dealing with removing and recharging cameras, take a closer look at the Circle Cam . The Good -Weatherproofing seems durable on the camera and much better on the extension cable accessory - degree wide field of view with night vision -Mobile app works nicely and has alerts for specific activities The Bad -Install is very hit-or-miss. Many times the app got stuck on ""Getting Ready"" or ""Connecting to Your Cloud"" with no further info on why. It's very difficult to troubleshoot without more info -It has one of the most mushy reset buttons on any piece of electronics I have ever -Can't create smart zones on the app at all or change WiFi networks without reinstalling the camera all over The Ugly -WiFi reception from the camera is mediocre to poor. The cameras seem to go offline for no real reasons and don't always come back on their own -Some features require a pricey monthly or yearly per-camera subscription with no options for multi-camera plans (yet) Review I recently Circle cams as from the feature set they best matched needs. After a lot of trial and error during install they're up and working mostly as expected. I've had some issues with them going offline randomly though they seem to come back on their own after a few minutes. It's very nice to have alerts when a person is detected though these will require a premium subscription on a per-camera basis. (yikes) The mobile app works pretty well and the web interface is nice too. This allows for multiple people to be viewing at the same time though keep in mind quality may degrade depending on your upload speeds. Some folks mentioned being disappointing that this camera only records when it detects activity but this wasn't an issue for me. There are better options for those ok with recharging or already invested in another ecosystem like Nest. In certain applications a full install of a local system would also serve better if running cables and managing local video is an option for you. If the hardware is stable after a few weeks and the wi-fi issues quiet down I'll keep them and consider purchasing a plan for one - not all three at $ a year - as they more than meet requirements.",2012,"@belbeze.com, @irit.fr, @irit.fr",1001183

I like gadgets and have held off buying something like this for a long time due to the mixed reviews of various products. However, I am very satisfied with this. My friend also bought one immediately after seeing mine in and he was logged in viewing it from another country! I have a very slow upload speed on internet, around .Mb but it still works fine but it can stutter at times when viewing the live picture as this is streamed from the cloud. The key here is to ensure you have a good internet speed and a strong WiFi signal. It would make sense to check the WiFi signal on your mobile phone in the area you are thinking of citing this camera. I have the wired version but don't be mistaken by this term. It just means wired to your electric via a plug. There is no ethernet cable option. I have spent a lot of time fiddling with the notification options. The camera is very reliable in of telling me whether a person / people have walked within range or if it's a car or cat. Because of the way camera is located, it overlooks the road in front of house. This means I received loads of notifications at first until I drew a zone via desktop web browser which was a doddle. This means I now only receive notifications from within the zone i.e. the garden and not the street in front of it. However, even with a zone set, I was still receiving notifications when cars drove past. I think this is because of the headlights shining into zone. I have now resolved that within the app by setting it to only notify me if a person is identified within the zone. So far so good. But, the zone feature and person detection is part of their paid for service of √Ç¬£. a year or √Ç¬£. a month. They offer a free trial and it's definitely worth it for me so I will be taking that up. You get  hours free storage of recordings but with the paid for premium subscription you get  days. There is a  day basic subscription option which is cheaper (√Ç¬£. a month) but without the zones and without person detection. These are the prices displayed to me when logged in to their control panel via a desktop. On their UK pages the prices ares still displayed in US Dollars despite selecting UK. These prices are per camera which is a bit tight!√¢¬Ä¬® I have this camera working fine on their app on an iPhone, iPad and Samsung Note (Android). We have also tested it via a desktop browser and friend who is overseas, was able to log in and view the live pictures and the recorded scenes of activity that it stores. I am yet to test this with Amazon Echo. Every time there is activity in zone (and outside zone) the system automatically records it. I only receive notifications for what happens in zone relating to people as explained above but it still records everything regardless. This can be disabled completely if you so wish. You can also have the system stop alerting you if you are at home if location services are turned on, on your device. The app enables you to select p, p (I this as internet isn't great) and p. You can also choose your field of view i.e.  degrees, wide and ultra-wide. The camera is great at night although I have a street light in front of so I can√¢¬Ä¬ôt provide more on that at the moment. I will report back when I add a camera at the rear of which is very dark at night. You can speak through the camera and also listen. These features can be disabled, as can the LED. There is a privacy mode which prevents the system from recording and does not send notifications. It still streams live though but you can turn the camera off from the app easily at any time. I have the app running full screen on iPad when at office so I can continually watch what's going on at home. In a morning, you can see all the time-stamped activity from during the night. These are displayed in bubbles which you circle through easily to view what happened e.g. cars driving past, people ",2012,"@univ-orleans.fr, @unicaen.fr, @cesi.fr",1001200

I√¢¬Ä¬ôve been looking to buy some form of CCTV for a few months, I contemplated the Arlo Pro HD wireless option, the wireless version of this camera and lastly a wired system including a dvr....

I have this camera for a couple of days and I have to say for the most part I am pretty impressed, the footage available during the day is really very good, clear with good sound if required and the degree viewing angle is good.  I am reserving judgement on the nighttime quality until I it for a few days / nights. The apps for viewing on both the iPad or I watch are good and they connect to the live feed within a few seconds.

Having bought an original Logi Circle in , I was really impressed and decided to get of the wired Logi Circle cameras.  They certainly didn't disappoint.  Optics have been improved and the cameras themselves look a lot nicer.  They have a very modular feel to them as they can be combined with different mounts.  They have a generous ft USB cable supplied which should allow for easy mounting anywhere.  When wall mounted, the mount does feel a bit unsturdy as it's simply supported by tiny clips that attach to the wall mount.  The ball pivot is quite nice and firm, so I don't expect the camera to sag, however, I'm not confident it'll maintain the stiffness if it is moved around a lot.  The Circle cameras also seem to be slower to restart/boot than the original and there have been some (occasional) noticeable delays in the live feed.  The app itself is very easy to and adding a camera is very simple.  One thing to note is that the initial firmware update took a very long time (approx mins), so don't panic and think it's frozen or stuck!  The monthly subscriptions are pretty expensive when you have cameras, so a multi camera discount would be really useful.  That said, the  hours free storage should be OK for most people if you're buying these for home security and you can always opt in to plans if you are going on holiday.  And on the note of security, it's a shame factor authentication isn't supported by the app.  I'd say these are an excellent upgrade over the original Logi Circle and definitely worth consideration if you're looking for cameras that work out of the box.",2012,,1001155

I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had the camera up for two days the quality is great (its better then the one I have inside).  However, the recommended camera setting times out after  seconds so the camer is only recording when you look at the app and √¢¬Ä¬úwake√¢¬Ä¬ù the camera up. After you close out the camera will timeout after  seconds and stop recording. The camera is not motion so it will not record if someone or something comes within range. Also, when we have the camera on this setting the projected battery life is months which is great but again I√¢¬Ä¬ôve only had It for two days so I have not experienced this. The other setting is not recommended as it√¢¬Ä¬ôll drain your battery within a day or so but this setting will record %.

The setup was easy.  There are a variety of settings to customize it for your particular application.  The video quality is really good on the P setting. For application, it monitors a pathway that should be very low traffic and I want to know when ever there is activity there.  It is set for high sensitivity in this low traffic area so I am sure to get an alert anytime there is activity there.  Once I get an alert, I can view the video of the activity that caused the alert on Android phone app from whereever I am. While we are away, this gives great peace of mind to know for sure that our has not been entered. The battery life for the application above has been great.  Three weeks after the last charge, the battery is at  percent. That's great! Of course, in higher traffic areas and when also using the LED illumination, I would expect the battery to drain faster. I would like this more if it came with a simple surface top mount.  I set it on a small glass which lets me set it on a shelf and adjust the angle of the egg shaped device.  Another thing I wish for is a few more days of free viewing. -hours is working for us, so we won't be opting for the -day storage/retreival option, thus avoiding the monthly charges.

After one month of use, I have not had a single time when the camera disconnected from our Wi-Fi router. It's a solid connection! PROS: - Easy setup - Great video quality at P - Long battery life in low traffic application - Reliable alerts to a smart phone app - Easy to view video from a smart phone app CONS: - No simple platform mount to simply set it on a shelf. - Proprietary server required.. no local DIY option - Monthly costs for more than  hours of storage/retrieval.",2011,"@orange-ftgroup.com, @orange-ftgroup.com, @imag.fr, @gmail.com",1000947

Once installed it was easy to get set up on the app. When it's working this camera is great for the price, HOWEVER it has two downsides: the first is that it requires a very strong and fast wifi connection in order to work properly, and the second is that the notification system on your phone when someone activates the camera is very buggy. The notifications are slow, and are often not received until after the person has left door, or not at all. The camera also keeps going offline - which again, I suspect is due to there not being a strong enough wifi signal. The next step is to improve the wifi signal to the camera to see if that improves the overall performance.

I also bought the window mount so I could see activity in driveway. The camera very easy to set up.  It has a wide view that Logitech says is  degrees.  I don't think it's quite that large, but I have no way of measuring. I bought this camera because it is compatible with HomeKit.  For the most part it is, but there is one big issue that Logitech has not been able to resolve.  I've been waiting to write review to see if they had a resolution to problem.  After months and many calls to their tech line, the issue remains. I installed the Logi Circle app on iPhone.  Within the app I can look onto driveway and I get an alert when there is motion in driveway. When I add the camera to the Home app, two accessories appear.  One is the camera and the other is the motion detector.  The camera work as expected from the Home app, but the motion detector never gets any notifications.  I would like to automate what happens when there is motion in driveway.  For example, I would like the Home app to turn on a light.  I can't do this because the Home app doesn't get any notification that there has been motion even though the Circle app sends me notifications when there is motion. I have called Logitech about this multiple times.  It seems that if the Circle app is able to detect motion, all it needs to do is to forward that information to the Home app.  This doesn't happen.  Logitech says it's because the camera is mounted on a window.  This doesn't make sense because the Circle app sends me notifications when there is motion.  Why can't it forward these notifications to he Home app?  I don't know and no one can explain the problem. So, other than this one issue, this is a very nice camera.  If it's true that the camera can't send me motion notifications when it's mounted to the window, then Logitech is omitting key information from it's advertising.  I don't believe this though.  This sounds like a software problem that they could resolve with a software update to the Circle app or a firmware update to the camera or both.  I am very disappointed in the response I've received.",2011,@univ-paris13.fr,1000997

So this review will be a little bit of a comparison between the cameras. First, let me say that the Circle is a very good camera, well built, and its setup is a breeze. What I like about this model is that its battery can last a long time compared to the st model but this is the only advantage it has. What I don't like is that its base is not magnetic as the st one, so you have to drill holes in the wall to install it, which makes it loose its portability. Other annoying things are the tiny ""loose"" base, the camera is heavy, so the base neck can't hold it well in place, also, the provided USB cable is very short. It is true that the camera can hold a charge for very long, but what if you installed it to monitor your home while on a long vacation? It will need to be plugged in.

I tend to do a lot of research first before buying tech stuff.

At first we put it on an upstairs windowledge but the night vision isnt great as it reflects off the glass, but at the weekend husband attached it to the front of our garage. Firstly make sure you have a half decent wifi signal where you are going to put it. We have put a wifi repeater in the garage to boost the signal and its done the job! The camera looks smart and has a decent build quality and was so easy to set up, I even managed it myself (a very non techy  odd yr old who normally relies on her husband to set things up!!!). It is very user friendly and the sound and picture quality are amazing. We find ourselves sitting and looking at it live on our phones. It records upto hrs for free, which is about the best one going without having to pay extra every month. You can upgrade and pay for more recording time, but we dont feel that necessary for our use.  I particularly like the Day Brief, which zooms through the whole days recording at speed. We are so impressed we are buying one for the back garden as we are onto open fields.

This has SERIOUS implications and is a clear case of over-engineering! Here's the story. Last night, I returned to apartment at :pm after a full day at work, to be greeted by a loud hissing sound and the smell of gas! I immediately ran out, called , and the fire department determined that water heater had failed, with the burner in the water heater as the source for the gas, and the loud hiss coming from leaking water. So Circle flawlessly records me, busting in to apartment at :pm, running out, and then all the firemen coming in, etc. Great.

The previous recording before that is when I left apartment at :am.  THERE IS NO WAY to access the unchanging video between :a and :p to hear when the hissing sound started. This is a case of over-engineering.  If you say the camera records the last  hours of history, I should be able to jump to any point in that history, no questions asked. That's what we expect a recording camera to do.  I wrote in to about this and got some form-letter answer which basically said the camera doesn't do this. So buyer beware!!!

Cons: star off for Battery that is draining like crazy, lasts week per charge and no much activity so indeed a faulty battery or is it really standard? - more star off with Support handler that could be a little more firm when attaching the cam, I suspect heavy wind could knock it off and ...well, having it broken is not an option due to lack of design vs its price - Extra features (zone area, etc...) at an extra cost.",2010,@inria.fr,1001268

I've been looking to get security cameras fitted in home for some time so was happy to give these a try. Firstly, everything comes very well packaged and in individual boxes within one larger box. All boxes are clearly labelled for identification. My first issue was the vague printed instructions within the packaging. Take advice and ignore these printed instructions. You can them for assembly purposes but for actually setting up the connection, just download and install the ""Logo Circle"" app from the Game Store/App Store. Connection was an absolute breeze. Run the app and follow the instructions. Both cameras found the wifi signal immediately and connected without any issues. *One they were connected, a firmware update was downloaded and installed on both cameras which took about minutes. I have one camera set up in the hallway and it gives wonderful crisp and bright images. Sound is loud and clear both ways too. Latency (delay in the image being displayed) is no more than seconds for me so no issues there. The second camera I have set up in the front window using the window mount. We have double glazed windows and this causes no issues whatsoever for us. The image is still crystal clear and night time images (in our street which is illuminated with street lamps) is satisfactory if a little blurry on moving subjects. Anyone suffering from poor images - just in case you haven't already done so - remover the protective film from the face of the cameras. It does make a considerable difference. USB Power connection cables are a reasonable length so I haven't had problems with where to mount the cameras. There are plenty of settings via the app. Such as image resolution (p / p / p), Field of view (Wide / Ultra Wide /  degrees), LED on/off, Speaker on/off. When using the window mount, the setting in the app for Night Vision defaults to ""Window"" which switches the camera to night vision automatically when it gets dark. In this situation, when using the window mount, the LED stays OFF to avoid reflections from the glass. All in all, they are not cheap, but they are really useful to have around the house. I do not subscribe to the additional storage features (which require a subscription fee) so I only get a rolling  hours of storage for cameras, but I find this is enough. Footage is extremely easy to download ti you device or computer and there is also a screen grab feature that you can to take snapshots of any point in the video. I love them!",2010,@lirmm.fr,1001319

I received the Logitech Circle but I own Window mount for the camera, as I did not want the cameras inside, nor did I really have a good set up for power if I put them outdoors. I thought that the window mount would be the perfect solution. Well what they don't really tell you about the window mount is that the camera can no longer do night vision because the lights would just bounce off the window panes. So this camera is pretty much useless at night unless you've got a constant source of bright light (like a security light). During the day, the system lets me know when oak tree moves in the wind (to be fair, so does Ring doorbell). All in all, it's an 'ok' system, but still quite a few bugs, and the window mount is very limited in usefulness.

The Logitech Circle knocks this out of the park on almost every feature. Perhaps I should start with the one area that Nokia scores and that is basic design. The Nokia camera looks class, and can be plonked down on almost anything. The Logitech camera looks flimsy, plastic-y and cheap. It is none of these things in practice. The kit I have comes with two cameras and a separate window mount (in addition to the standard mounts). The packaging is very good, with each camera and each mount in separate boxes. You can buy extra camera up to a total of four (I think) on any system. Set-up is pretty straightforward. Download the app and follow the instructions. If anything goes wrong you can reset everything and start again. Within minutes (probably less) it will all be working. The pack I have was the wired camera and to be honest the lead could be longer. The recommended height for installation is ft, but you only get ft of lead, so unless you install right above the plug socket and ft high installation is impossible. The camera can be screwed to a wall, or be free standing, and comes with all the necessary screws etc. The camera is apparently shower-proof but for external installation you√¢¬Ä¬ôd need an electrician, obviously. That or buy the wireless camera instead. The window mount allows the camera to be stuck to a window using sticky pads. You only get on spare set of these pads, so make sure experiment a bit before sticking the camera up. But onto the crucial question √¢¬Ä¬ì how well does it all work? To a great extent the performance of any camera like this will be dependent on the app as much as the hardware, and over time apps can be improved, but at the moment (April ) Logitech leaves the (slightly more expensive) Nokia for standing. The picture is delayed by a couple of seconds but is sharp, and the video flows well without any jerks, and shows near  degrees in front of the camera. Sound quality is okay √¢¬Ä¬ì it could be louder - but it does not break up like the Nokia. Replay of recorded incidents (the camera detects movement and sound and records automatically) is almost instant √¢¬Ä¬ì and it very cleverly records from a second or two before the movement (so it rather impressively records lightning flashes!) √¢¬Ä¬ì replays also leave the Nokia for dead. Output can be watch on the linked device √¢¬Ä¬ì or on a dedicated, password controlled, website (the Nokia limits you to the device alone). You also can pinch-zoom in and out, and set the camera up so it alerts movement or sound, with an option for √¢¬Ä¬úmovement zones√¢¬Ä¬ù in the picture. You can record movement for up to  hours on the free setting, or - days with a subscription that is massively cheaper than the Nokia and download both still and moving images very easily. Sound is two-way so you can remotely scare the heck out of any poor unsuspecting person who may be near the camera! Switching between cameras is easy √¢¬Ä¬ì and the second or subsequent cameras could, in theory. be put on a totally different network in a totally different location. The night vision is pretty impressive √¢¬Ä¬ì though this does not work with the window mount as the camera√¢¬Ä¬ôs infrared light bounces back off the glass and blinds itself. It would make a very good baby monitor, despite not being sold as that (the Nokia ironically is sold with that as a possible use, despite being terrible in practice). Overall, it√¢¬Ä¬ôs pretty impressive. If installing outside, or in a porch, then go for the wireless cameras, but within the home the slightly cheaper wired cameras are more than adequate. I also have to say that I do have a pretty good wifi, which will have helped picture quality. If your wifi is not strong, or not strong in the area of your house where you wish to install a camera, you may want to install a signal booster for best results √¢¬Ä¬ì but that would apply to any wifi-based device.",2010,"@upmc.fr, @upmc.fr",1001371

Some great things about these cameras and there's also some things that I think for the price are rather off putting. The cable length is good and the minimal sockets that go into the wall and very neat. The wide-angle view is good but do bear in mind that this causes a rather big fishbowl effect to achieve it. Window mount... If you have double glazing then don't expect this to work well at all when the infrared version of the camera is active, you merely get the reflection of the room it's in. HomeKit, If you put the flyer in each of the camera boxes to one side you made a mistake as this is where the HomeKit is located. It's also printed very faintly in the rear of the camera but in a different hyphenated pattern which is odd. You can add the cameras to your Apple Home App so you can see all the camera on your favorites screen too. Setup is a breeze and both cameras were online, screwed and drilled to the wall and connected via HomeKit within  minutes. Mic / Speaker This really isn't up to much, audible quality to listen to but to send voice to the camera is too quiet√¢¬Ä¬ã. Having heard the battery pack is not up to much I am not going to rush out and buy one to put the camera in a more remote area... The neat bits of the software such as hotspots to activate to prevent lots of false alarms, Subscription extra)... I don't agree with this at all. When you've paid quite a high price I want to be able to do what I want with the footage and that means I perhaps don't want it sat on a random server accessible to any hackers. With another system, I I backup to NAS drive and another cloud service that I have chosen without paying additional subscriptions. Overall I think the cameras are good, they don't, however, justify the price point and going with a subscription service puts the cost of the camera even higher. The ability to work with smart apps like stringify and IFTT is a bonus that a couple of cameras don't have. I wouldn't discourage someone from buying these but I'd certainly recommend you to check what else is available to you.",2010,"@univ-metz.fr, @univ-paris13.fr",1001412

The window mounting contains a flexible window camera cover (a real pain to get onto the camera) a window mount (even bigger pain to get onto the flexible cover) and window mount with  feet (m) cable; USB adapter; fixing screws and spare adhesive strips which holds the camera to the window. It needs to have clear view; There is an app you download to your phone that helps you locate the camera in the best position. The cameras have to be placed within Wi-Fi range so they can stream HD video with audio so are best placed in locations that get the best Wi-Fi reception, otherwise you will need a Wi-Fi booster. The camera√¢¬Ä¬ôs can be used outside and are weatherproof but you need to a Circle accessory- weatherproof Extension cable and have a weatherproof socket outside. The inside camera is easier to locate close to electric sockets and better Wi-Fi range. The window camera is good if you don√¢¬Ä¬ôt place it in direct sunlight otherwise you get window glare that distorts the pictures.  The cameras have LED indicators that show if they are working properly. These are a bit of a give-away as you can clearly see where the cameras are located but can also be a deterrent. The night vision is good. The system is easy to set up; you just plug it In and then download the Logi Circle app to your phone which then allows you to keep an eye on your whilst away from home. The only problem I had with the cameras was getting the window mounted one to stay in place, getting the cover on it was a real pain and then getting it to stay in place on the window (it kept falling out).
